### Bank Account Balance Checker
#### Problem Description
You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance.
Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.

#### Code Solution
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if at any point the balance of the bank account falls below zero.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation
        balance += operation  # Update the balance by adding the current operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```
#### Explanation
The `below_zero` function takes a list of operations as input and initializes the balance to zero. It then iterates over each operation, updating the balance by adding the current operation. If the balance falls below zero, it returns True immediately. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns False. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations.
