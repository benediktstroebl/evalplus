### Solution for Detecting Below Zero Balance
#### Problem Statement
You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance.
Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and at that point function should return True.
Otherwise it should return False.

#### Python Solution
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Initialize the balance to zero
    balance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each operation in the list of operations
    for operation in operations:
        # Update the balance by adding the current operation
        balance += operation
        
        # If the balance falls below zero, return True immediately
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    # If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return False
    return False

# Test cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```
This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise. It does this by initializing a balance variable to zero and iterating over each operation in the list, updating the balance and checking if it falls below zero. If it does, the function returns `True` immediately. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`.
