    This function simulates a bank account with a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.
    It checks if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero and returns True, otherwise it returns False.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit (positive) and withdrawal (negative) operations.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.

    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero

    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance after each operation

        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True as soon as the balance falls below zero

    return False  # If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return False

```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations. It initializes the balance to zero and iterates through the operations, updating the balance after each operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
