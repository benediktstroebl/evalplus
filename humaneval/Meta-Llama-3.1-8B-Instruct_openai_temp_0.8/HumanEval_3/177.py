Here's a Python script that solves the problem in a self-contained manner:

```markdown
### Below Zero Balance Detection

This script defines a function `below_zero` that determines if a bank account's balance will ever fall below zero given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

#### Code

```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if a bank account's balance will ever fall below zero given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance will ever fall below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False


### Example Use Cases

print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

#### Explanation

The script defines a function `below_zero` that iterates through a list of operations, adding each operation to a running balance. As soon as the balance falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the function completes the iteration without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`.
