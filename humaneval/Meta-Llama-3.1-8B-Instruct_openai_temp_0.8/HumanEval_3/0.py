### Below Zero Balance Detection
#### Problem Statement
You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance.
Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and at that point function should return True.
Otherwise it should return False.

#### Python Solution
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.
    
    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.
            A positive number represents a deposit, a negative number represents a withdrawal.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance of account falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation
        balance += operation  # Update the balance
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True if the balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```
#### Explanation
This solution iterates over each operation in the list. For each operation, it updates the balance by adding the operation. If the balance falls below zero, it immediately returns True. If it iterates over all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns False.
