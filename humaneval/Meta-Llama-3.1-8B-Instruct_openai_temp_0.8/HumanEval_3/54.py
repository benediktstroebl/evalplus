### Solution: Detecting Balance Below Zero

The following Python script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account and returns `True` if the balance falls below zero at any point, and `False` otherwise.

```markdown
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero

    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance after each operation

        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # Return True as soon as the balance falls below zero

    return False  # Return False if the balance never falls below zero

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This script uses a single loop to iterate over the operations, updating the balance after each operation and checking if it falls below zero. If the balance falls below zero, the function returns `True` immediately. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`.
