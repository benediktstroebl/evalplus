    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    for operation in operations:  # Iterate over each operation in the list
        balance += operation  # Add the operation to the balance
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero

```

In this script, we initialize the balance to zero and then iterate over each operation in the list. For each operation, we add it to the balance and check if the balance falls below zero. If it does, we return True immediately. If we've iterated over all operations and the balance is still non-negative, we return False.
