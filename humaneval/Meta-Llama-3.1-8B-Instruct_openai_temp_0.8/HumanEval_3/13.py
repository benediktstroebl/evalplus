Here's a Python script that uses a simple iterative approach to solve the problem:

### Bank Account Balance Checker

#### Problem Description

You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with 
zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, 
and at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.

#### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if at any point the balance of account falls below zero.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero

    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance for each operation
        
        # If the balance falls below zero, return True immediately
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    # If no operation caused the balance to fall below zero, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This script initializes a balance variable to zero and iterates over each operation in the list. 
For each operation, the balance is updated by adding the operation. As soon as the balance falls 
below zero, the function returns True. If no operation caused the balance to fall below zero, 
the function returns False.
