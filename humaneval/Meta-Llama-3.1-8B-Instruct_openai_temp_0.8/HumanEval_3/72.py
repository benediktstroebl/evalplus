### Detecting Negative Balance in Bank Account Operations

This Python script defines a function to check if a bank account's balance falls below zero due to a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

#### Code

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if the balance of a bank account falls below zero due to a list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations. Positive values represent deposits, while negative values represent withdrawals.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Expected output: True
```

#### Explanation

*   We initialize the `balance` variable to zero, representing the initial balance of the bank account.
*   We iterate through each operation in the `operations` list.
*   For each operation, we add it to the `balance` to simulate the deposit or withdrawal.
*   If the `balance` becomes negative at any point, we immediately return `True`.
*   If we finish iterating through all operations without the `balance` becoming negative, we return `False`.

You can use this script as a starting point for solving the problem. The provided unit tests demonstrate the expected behavior of the `below_zero` function.
