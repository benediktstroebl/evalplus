# Test cases
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True

```

In this script, we define a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the balance falls below 0 at any point. We initialize the balance to 0 and then iterate over each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the current operation. If the balance falls below 0 at any point, we return True. If the function hasn't returned True by now, it means the balance never fell below 0, so we return False. Finally, we include some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
