### Problem: Detecting a Balance Below Zero in a Bank Account

The goal is to determine if the balance of a bank account falls below zero during a series of deposit and withdrawal operations.

### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance.
    It returns True if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.
            A positive integer represents a deposit, and a negative integer represents a withdrawal.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to zero
    
    # Iterate over each operation in the list
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance by adding the current operation
        
        # If the balance falls below zero, return True immediately
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    
    # If we've iterated over all operations and the balance never fell below zero, return False
    return False
```

### Example Use Cases

```python
# Test case 1: No withdrawals
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False

# Test case 2: Withdrawals cause the balance to fall below zero
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
```

This solution uses a simple iterative approach to keep track of the balance. It increments the balance by each operation and checks if it falls below zero. If it does, the function returns True immediately. If it iterates over all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns False.
