This script defines a function `below_zero` that iterates over a list of operations, updating the balance after each operation. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns `False`. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
