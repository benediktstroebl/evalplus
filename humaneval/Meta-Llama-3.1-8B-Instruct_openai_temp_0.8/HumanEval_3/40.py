### Below Zero Balance Detector
#### Python Script

```markdown
**below_zero.py**
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if at any point the balance of a bank account falls below zero.

    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with zero balance.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize the balance to 0

    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Apply each operation to the balance
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance falls below zero
            return True  # If it does, return True immediately

    return False  # If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return False


# Example usage:
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This script defines a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations (deposit and withdrawal) as input, applies each operation to the balance, and returns `True` as soon as the balance falls below zero. If the balance never falls below zero, the function returns `False`.
