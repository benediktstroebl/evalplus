This Python script includes a function `is_prime` that checks whether a given number is prime or not. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it immediately returns `False` because prime numbers by definition are greater than 1. Then it iterates over all numbers from 2 up to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `n` is divisible, it means `n` is not a prime number and the function returns `False`. If the function finishes checking without finding any divisors, it means `n` is a prime number and it returns `True`.

The script also includes test cases to verify that the `is_prime` function is working correctly. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(âˆšn), which is more efficient than checking every number up to n, which would have a time complexity of O(n). This is because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
