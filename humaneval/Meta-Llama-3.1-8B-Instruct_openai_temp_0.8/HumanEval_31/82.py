This script uses a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it's not prime. Then it checks if the number is 2 or 3, in which case it is prime. Next, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, in which case it's not prime. Finally, it checks the number for divisibility by all numbers in the range from 5 to the square root of the number, incrementing by 6 each time (since all primes are of the form 6k Â± 1). If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it's prime.
