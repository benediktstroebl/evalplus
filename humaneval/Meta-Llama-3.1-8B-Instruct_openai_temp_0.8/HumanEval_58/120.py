This script defines the `common` function, which takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique common elements. The function uses Python's built-in `set` data structure to efficiently find the common elements and remove duplicates. The result is then converted back to a list and sorted using the `sorted` function. The script also includes docstrings and test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
