```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    This function takes two lists as input, finds the common elements, removes duplicates, 
    and returns the result in a sorted order.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and have efficient intersection
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (common elements)
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)

    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    common_list = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return common_list

# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input, finds their common elements, removes duplicates, and returns the result in a sorted order. The function uses Python's built-in `set` data type to efficiently find the intersection of the two lists. The result is sorted using the `sorted` function and returned as a list. The script also includes example test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
