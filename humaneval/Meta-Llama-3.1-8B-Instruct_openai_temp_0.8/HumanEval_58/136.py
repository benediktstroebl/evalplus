```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
    l1 (list): The first list.
    l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
    list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    common_elements = set1 & set2  # Find the intersection of the two sets
    return sorted(list(common_elements))  # Convert the set back to a list and sort it


# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))  # [1, 5, 653]
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))  # [2, 3]
```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists `l1` and `l2` as input, finds their common elements using set intersection, and returns the common elements in sorted order. The function is then tested with the provided example inputs.
