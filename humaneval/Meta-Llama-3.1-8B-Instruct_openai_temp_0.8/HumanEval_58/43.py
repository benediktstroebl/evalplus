```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list) -> list:
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert the lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Use set intersection to find the common elements
    common_elements = set1 & set2

    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    sorted_common_elements = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return sorted_common_elements

# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input, finds their common elements, removes duplicates, and returns the result as a sorted list. The function uses set operations to efficiently find the common elements. The script includes docstrings to document the function, and test cases at the end to demonstrate its usage.
