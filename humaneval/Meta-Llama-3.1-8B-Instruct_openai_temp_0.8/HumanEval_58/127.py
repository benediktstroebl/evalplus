```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list) -> list:
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements from both lists.

    Examples:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]

    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it

# Example usage:
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input, finds the common elements by intersecting the two lists, removes duplicates, and returns the sorted list of common elements. The function includes a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides example usage.
