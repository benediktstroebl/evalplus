### Common Elements in Two Lists

This script finds and returns the sorted unique common elements in two lists.

#### Code

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Examples:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    return sorted(set(l1) & set(l2))


# Example usage
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
```

#### Explanation

*   We use the `&` operator to find the intersection (common elements) between the two sets.
*   The `set` function is used to convert the lists into sets for efficient lookup.
*   The `sorted` function is used to sort the common elements in ascending order.
*   The result is returned as a list.
