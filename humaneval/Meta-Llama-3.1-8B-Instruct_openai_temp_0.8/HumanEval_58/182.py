```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A list of sorted unique common elements.

    Examples:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Use set intersection to find common elements
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)

    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list and sort it
    return sorted(list(common_elements))


# Example usage:
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique common elements. It uses sets to improve lookup efficiency and remove duplicates, then converts the result back to a list and sorts it before returning. The function includes docstrings that describe its behavior, arguments, and return value, as well as examples of usage. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the function with sample inputs.
