```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list of elements.
        l2 (list): The second list of elements.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert the lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (i.e., the common elements)
    common_elements = set1 & set2

    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list and sort it
    common_list = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return common_list

# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
# Output: [1, 5, 653]

print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
# Output: [2, 3]
```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique common elements. The function uses sets to improve lookup efficiency and removes duplicates by converting the lists to sets before finding their intersection. The result is then converted back to a list and sorted before being returned. The script also includes example usage and output to demonstrate the function's behavior.
