```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list) -> list:
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert the lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Find the intersection of the two sets (common elements)
    common_set = set1 & set2
    
    # Convert the set back to a list, sort it, and return it
    return sorted(list(common_set))

# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of their unique common elements. It uses set operations to improve efficiency. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
