```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list) -> list:
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    return sorted(set(l1) & set(l2))


# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input, converts them to sets to remove duplicates, finds their intersection using the `&` operator, converts the result back to a list, and sorts it before returning it. The function includes a docstring with examples to make it clear how to use the function and how it works.
