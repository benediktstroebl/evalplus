### Common Elements in Two Lists
#### Problem Description
This script finds the sorted unique common elements between two lists.

#### Code
```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
    l1 (list): The first list.
    l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
    list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Examples:
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]

    """
    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (i.e., common elements)
    common_set = set1 & set2

    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    common_list = sorted(list(common_set))

    return common_list

# Example usage:
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
```

This script first converts the input lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency. It then finds the intersection of the two sets (i.e., the common elements) using the `&` operator. Finally, it converts the set back to a list, sorts it, and returns the result.
