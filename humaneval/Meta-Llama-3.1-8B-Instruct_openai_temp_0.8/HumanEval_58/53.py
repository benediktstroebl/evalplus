### Common Elements in Two Lists
#### Problem Description
The following Python script solves the problem of finding common elements in two lists. The common elements are then sorted in ascending order and returned.

#### Code
```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list of elements.
        l2 (list): The second list of elements.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Examples:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (common elements)
    common_elements = set1 & set2

    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list and sort it
    result = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return result

# Example usage:
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))  # Output: [1, 5, 653]
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))  # Output: [2, 3]
```
This script first converts the input lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency. It then finds the intersection of the two sets (common elements) using the `&` operator. Finally, it converts the set of common elements back to a list, sorts it, and returns the result.
