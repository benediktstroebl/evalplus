### Common Elements in Two Lists
#### Problem Statement
Given two lists of integers, return a sorted list of unique common elements.

#### Solution

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]

    :param l1: The first list of integers.
    :param l2: The second list of integers.
    :return: A sorted list of unique common elements.
    """
    # Convert the lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (i.e., common elements)
    common_elements = set1 & set2

    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list and sort it
    common_list = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return common_list

# Example usage:
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))  # [1, 5, 653]
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))  # [2, 3]
```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists of integers as input, finds their common elements using set intersection, removes duplicates, and returns the common elements in sorted order. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with two test cases.
