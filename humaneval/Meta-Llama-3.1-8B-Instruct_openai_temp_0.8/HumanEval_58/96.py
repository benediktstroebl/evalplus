```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    s1 = set(l1)
    s2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (i.e., common elements)
    common_elements = s1 & s2

    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    result = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return result

# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input, finds the unique common elements by converting them to sets and taking their intersection, and returns the sorted list of common elements. The function is then tested with the provided examples.
