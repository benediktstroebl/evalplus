```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list) -> list:
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Examples:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]

    # Convert the lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Find the intersection of the two sets, which are the common elements
    common_elements = set1 & set2

```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique common elements. It uses the set data structure to improve lookup efficiency and remove duplicates. The function is then tested with the provided examples.
