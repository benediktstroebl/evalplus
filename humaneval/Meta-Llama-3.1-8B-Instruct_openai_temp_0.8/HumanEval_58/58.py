```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    return sorted(set(l1) & set(l2))


# Test the function
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
```

In this script, the `common` function takes two lists as input, converts them to sets (which automatically removes any duplicates), finds their intersection using the `&` operator, and then converts the result back to a list. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of common elements. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's usage.
