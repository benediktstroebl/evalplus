```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]

        [2, 3]

    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (i.e., the common elements)
    common_elements = set1 & set2

    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    result = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return result

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists `l1` and `l2` as input. It first converts the lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency. Then, it finds the intersection of the two sets (i.e., the common elements) and converts the resulting set back to a list. Finally, it sorts the list and returns it. The function is tested with two example inputs.
