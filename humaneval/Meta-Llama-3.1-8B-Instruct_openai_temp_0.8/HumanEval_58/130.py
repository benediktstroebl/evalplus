```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of unique common elements.

    Examples:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]

        [2, 3]

    # Convert lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets (i.e., the common elements)
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)

    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it

This script defines the `common` function, which takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of unique common elements. It uses the `set` data structure to efficiently find the intersection of the two lists (i.e., the common elements), and then converts the result back to a list and sorts it before returning it. The script also includes docstrings and example usage to explain how the function works.
