Here's a well-documented Python script that solves the problem:

```markdown
# Function to find the common elements in two lists
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """
    Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.

    Args:
        l1 (list): The first list.
        l2 (list): The second list.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted unique common elements.

    Example:
        >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
        [1, 5, 653]
        >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
        [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert the lists to sets to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of the two sets, which are the common elements
    common_elements = set1 & set2

    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list and sort it
    result = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return result

# Example usage
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))
```

This script defines a function `common` that takes two lists as input, finds their common elements by taking the intersection of the two sets, removes duplicates, sorts the result, and returns it. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with the provided test cases.
