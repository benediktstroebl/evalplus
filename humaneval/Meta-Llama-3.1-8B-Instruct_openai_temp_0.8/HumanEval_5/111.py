This script uses a simple iterative approach to solve the problem. It first checks if the input list is empty and returns an empty list in that case. Then it initializes the result list with the first element of the input list. It iterates over the rest of the input list, appends the delimeter, and then the current number to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, and a space complexity of O(n) as well, since in the worst-case scenario, the result list will be twice as long as the input list.
