This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and an integer as input, and returns the modified list with the delimeter inserted between every two consecutive elements. The function uses a simple iterative approach to build the modified list. It handles the edge case where the input list is empty and returns it as is. The test cases at the end verify the correctness of the function.
