```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
        delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between the elements of the input list.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with the delimeter inserted between every two consecutive elements.
    """
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        result.append(num)
        result.append(delimeter)
    # Remove the extra delimeter at the end of the list if it's not empty
    if result:
        result.pop()
    return result

# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```
However, for a more efficient solution that doesn't require appending and then removing an element from the list, you can use the following approach:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers`

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
        delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between the elements of the input list.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with the delimeter inserted between every two consecutive elements.
    """
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:  # Check if it's not the last element
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result

# Test cases
print(intersperse([], 4))  # []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```
This version of the function only appends the delimeter if there's another number to follow it, avoiding the need to remove an extra delimeter at the end of the list.
