        delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with the delimeter inserted between elements.

```

This script defines the `intersperse` function that inserts a delimeter between every two consecutive elements of an input list. The test cases are included to demonstrate the function's behavior.
