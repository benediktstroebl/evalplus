```python
from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
        delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The modified list with delimeter inserted.

    Examples:
        >>> intersperse([], 4)
        []
        >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
        [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:  # check if we are not at the last element
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result


# Test the function
print(intersperse([], 4))  # []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0))  # [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5]
```

This script defines a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers and a delimiter as input, and returns a new list where the delimiter is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the original list. It uses a simple loop to append each element of the input list to the result list, followed by the delimiter if we are not at the last element. The script also includes some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
