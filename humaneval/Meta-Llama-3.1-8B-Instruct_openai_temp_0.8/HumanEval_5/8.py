### Interspersing Elements in a List
#### Python Function to Insert a Number Between Consecutive Elements

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers`.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): The input list of integers.
        delimeter (int): The number to be inserted between consecutive elements.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The list with the delimeter inserted between consecutive elements.
    """
    if not numbers:  # If the input list is empty, return it as is
        return numbers

    result = [numbers[0]]  # Start with the first element of the input list
    for num in numbers[1:]:  # Iterate over the rest of the list
        result.append(delimeter)  # Insert the delimeter before each number
        result.append(num)
    return result

# Example usage:
print(intersperse([], 4))  # []
print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This Python function `intersperse` takes a list of integers `numbers` and a number `delimeter` as input, and returns a new list where the `delimeter` is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list. The function uses a simple iterative approach to build the resulting list. If the input list is empty, it returns the empty list as is.
