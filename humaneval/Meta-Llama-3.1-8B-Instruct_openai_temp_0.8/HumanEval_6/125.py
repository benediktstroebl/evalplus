    This function calculates the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for each group in a string.
    
    Parameters:

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.

```

This script uses a simple counter-based approach to keep track of the current and maximum nesting levels. It splits the input string into groups, iterates over each group, and for each group, it iterates over each character to update the counters and maximum level as necessary. Finally, it returns a list of the maximum nesting levels for each group.
