### Nested Parentheses Parser
```python
from typing import List
import re

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Parse a string of nested parentheses to find the deepest level of nesting for each group.

    Args:
    paren_string (str): A string of groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of the deepest levels of nesting for each group.

    Example:
    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the input string into groups
    groups = paren_string.split()

    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    results = []

    # Loop over each group
    for group in groups:
        # Use a stack to keep track of the nesting level
        stack = []
        max_level = 0

        # Loop over each character in the group
        for char in group:
            # If the character is an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(char)
                # Update the maximum level if necessary
                max_level = max(max_level, len(stack))
            # If the character is a closing parenthesis, pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack
            elif char == ')':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()

        # The result for this group is the maximum level of nesting
        results.append(max_level)

    return results
```

This script uses a stack to keep track of the nesting level of the parentheses in each group. It loops over each character in each group, incrementing the maximum level whenever it encounters an opening parenthesis and decrementing it whenever it encounters a closing parenthesis. The result for each group is the maximum level of nesting.
