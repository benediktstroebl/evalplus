This Python script defines a function `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string of nested parentheses groups as input and returns a list of the deepest level of nesting for each group. It uses a stack to keep track of the parentheses levels and updates the maximum level as it iterates through each group. If there's an unbalanced closing parenthesis in a group, it raises a `ValueError`. The script includes a test case to demonstrate the function's usage.
