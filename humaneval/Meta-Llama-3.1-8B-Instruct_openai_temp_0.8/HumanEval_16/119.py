```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to keep track of unique characters
    distinct_chars = set(string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Output: 4
```

This script uses a set to efficiently keep track of unique characters in the string. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements, making it ideal for this task. The script also includes docstrings and example usage to make it more understandable and reusable.
