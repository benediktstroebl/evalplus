```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Example:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lower case to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters
    # A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements
    unique_chars = set(string)
    
    # The number of distinct characters is the size of the set
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Expected output: 4
```

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input, converts it to lower case, and then counts the number of unique characters using a set. The function returns the count, which is the number of distinct characters in the string. The script then tests the function with two example inputs.
