```python

    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    lower_case_string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters
    distinct_chars = set(lower_case_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Expected output: 4

This script uses a set to store unique characters from the input string. Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, which makes them ideal for counting distinct characters. The `lower()` method is used to convert the string to lowercase, so that the same character in different cases is considered the same. The function then returns the number of elements in the set, which represents the number of distinct characters in the string.
