```python

    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters, sets in Python only store unique elements
    unique_chars = set(string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Expected output: 4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. The function works by converting the input string to lowercase, then using a set to store unique characters. The `len` function is used to get the number of elements in the set, which represents the number of distinct characters. The function's correctness is demonstrated with example use cases.
