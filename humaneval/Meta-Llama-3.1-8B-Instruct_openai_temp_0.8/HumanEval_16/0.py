    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Use a set to store unique characters, sets automatically remove duplicates
    unique_chars = set(string)
    
    # Return the number of unique characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Expected output: 4
```

This script defines the `count_distinct_characters` function which takes a string as input, converts it to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity, stores unique characters in a set, and returns the number of unique characters. The function is then tested with the provided examples.
