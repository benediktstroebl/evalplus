    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string.

    Examples:

        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. It uses a set to store unique characters, which automatically eliminates duplicates. The function is then tested with two example strings.
