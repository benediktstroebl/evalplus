    Example:

        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Expected output: 4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. It uses a set to store the distinct characters, which automatically removes any duplicates, and then returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters. The script also includes example use cases and test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
