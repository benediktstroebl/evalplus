```python

    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): Input string

    Returns:
        int: Number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    lower_case_string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to get distinct characters, because sets in Python only store unique elements
    distinct_characters = set(lower_case_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Output: 4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. It uses a set to get the distinct characters, and the `len` function to get the number of elements in the set. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
