```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters.

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Convert the string to lower case to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters
    unique_chars = set(string)
    
    # Return the number of unique characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Expected output: 4

This script uses a Python set to store unique characters in the string. Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. Therefore, it automatically removes any duplicate characters. The `len` function is then used to return the number of elements in the set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string. The string is converted to lower case to ignore case sensitivity.
