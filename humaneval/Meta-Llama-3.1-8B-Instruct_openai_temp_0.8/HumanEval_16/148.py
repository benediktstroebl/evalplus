```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Example:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters and get the number of elements
    # This is because sets in Python only store unique elements
    return len(set(string))

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. The function works by first converting the string to lowercase and then using a set to store unique characters. The number of elements in the set is then returned as the number of distinct characters. The script also includes example use cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
