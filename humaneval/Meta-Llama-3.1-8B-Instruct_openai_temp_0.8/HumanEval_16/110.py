```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters
    unique_chars = set(string)
    
    # The number of distinct characters is the size of the set
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Output: 4
```

This script uses a set to store unique characters. Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, so automatically removing any duplicates. The `lower()` method is used to convert the string to lowercase, so that the function is case insensitive.
