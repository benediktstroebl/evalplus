    Examples:

# Example usage:
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Output: 4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. The function uses a set to get a collection of unique characters and returns the length of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.
