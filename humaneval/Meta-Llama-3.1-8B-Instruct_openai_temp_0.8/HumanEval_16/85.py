    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Use a set to store unique characters
    unique_chars = set(lower_string)
    
    # Return the number of unique characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4
```

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case sensitivity. It uses a set to store unique characters, which automatically removes duplicates. The script then tests the function with the provided examples.
