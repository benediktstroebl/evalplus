    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:

# Test the function

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input, converts it to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity, and then uses a set to store unique characters. The number of distinct characters is then returned as the length of the set. The function is tested with the provided examples.
