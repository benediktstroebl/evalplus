```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters.

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lower case to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters. Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements.
    unique_chars = set()
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in string:
        # Add the character to the set
        unique_chars.add(char)
    
    # Return the number of unique characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Output: 4
```

Alternatively, you could use Python's `set` data type and the `update` method to simplify the code:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters.

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lower case to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters
    unique_chars = set()
    
    # Update the set with all characters from the string
    unique_chars.update(string)
    
    # Return the number of unique characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # Output: 4
```
