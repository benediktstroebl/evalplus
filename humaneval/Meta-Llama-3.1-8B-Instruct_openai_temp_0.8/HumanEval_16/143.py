```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters.

    Example:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lower case to ignore case sensitivity
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters, sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements
    # The len() function returns the number of items in an object
    return len(set(string))

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input, converts it to lower case to ignore case sensitivity, and returns the number of distinct characters in the string. The function uses a Python set, which automatically removes duplicates, to count the number of unique characters. The script then tests the function with the provided example inputs.
