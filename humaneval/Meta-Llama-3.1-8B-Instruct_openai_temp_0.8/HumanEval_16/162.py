    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) it consists of.

    Args:
    string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    int: The number of distinct characters in the string.

    Examples:
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input, converts it to lowercase, and counts the number of distinct characters by storing them in a set. The `set` data structure in Python automatically removes duplicates, so its size represents the number of unique characters in the string. The script then tests the function with the provided example strings.
