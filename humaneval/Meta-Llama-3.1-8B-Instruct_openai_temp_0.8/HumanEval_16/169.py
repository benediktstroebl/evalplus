    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    unique_chars = set(string)
    # Return the number of unique characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input, converts it to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity, and then uses a set to store unique characters. The number of unique characters is returned as the length of the set.
