    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

    Args:
        string (str): The input string

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4

    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_chars)

# Test the function
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Expected output: 3

This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input, converts it to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity, uses a set to get the distinct characters, and returns the number of distinct characters. The examples at the end of the script test the function with the provided test cases.
