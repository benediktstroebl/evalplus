This script defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string. It uses a set to store unique characters, which automatically removes duplicates. The function also handles case sensitivity by converting the input string to lowercase before processing. The script includes docstrings to provide documentation and examples of usage.
