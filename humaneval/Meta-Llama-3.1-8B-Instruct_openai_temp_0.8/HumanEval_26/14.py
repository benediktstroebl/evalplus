```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The list of integers with duplicates removed.

    Example:
        >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
        [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    
    return result

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This script uses a set (`seen`) to keep track of the elements that have already been added to the result list. The `if num not in seen` condition checks if the current number has been seen before. If not, it adds the number to the result list and the `seen` set. This way, we can ensure that we're not adding duplicate numbers to the result list, while preserving the original order of elements.
