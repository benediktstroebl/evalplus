```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of integers with duplicates removed.

    Example:
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
            
    return result

# Test the function
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
print(remove_duplicates([5, 3, 5, 2, 2, 4]))  # Output: [4, 3, 2]
```

This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with all elements that occur more than once removed. The function uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far. This allows it to determine whether a number is a duplicate in constant time.
