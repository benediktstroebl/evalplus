### Removing Duplicates from a List of Integers
#### Problem Description

Given a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once while maintaining the original order of elements.

#### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of integers with duplicates removed.

    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the count of each number
    num_count = {}
    
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the input list
    for num in numbers:
        # If the number is not in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary and the result list
        if num not in num_count:
            num_count[num] = 1
            result.append(num)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This solution works by iterating over the input list, counting the occurrence of each number in a dictionary, and adding each number to the result list only if it has not been seen before. This approach ensures that the original order of elements is maintained and duplicates are removed as required.
