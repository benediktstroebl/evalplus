def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers

    Returns:
        A list of integers with duplicates removed

    Examples:
        >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
        [1, 3, 4]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]

This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicates removed. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the elements it has seen so far, and a list `result` to store the elements that have not been seen before. It iterates over the input list, adding each element to `result` if it has not been seen before, and marks it as seen by adding it to `seen`. Finally, it returns the `result` list.
