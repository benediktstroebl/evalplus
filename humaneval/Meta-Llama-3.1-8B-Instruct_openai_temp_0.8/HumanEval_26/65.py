```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The input list with duplicates removed, preserving the original order.

    Example:
        >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
        [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
            result.append(num)
    
    return result

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicates removed. It uses a `set` to keep track of elements that have been seen so far, ensuring that only unique elements are added to the result list.
