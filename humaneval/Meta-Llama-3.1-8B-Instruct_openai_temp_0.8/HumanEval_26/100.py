```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
    numbers: A list of integers.

    Returns:
    A new list with duplicates removed.

    Example:
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
            result.append(num)
    return result

# Test the function
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicates removed. It uses a `set` to keep track of the elements it has seen so far, and appends each element to the result list only if it has not been seen before. The order of elements is preserved as in the input list.
