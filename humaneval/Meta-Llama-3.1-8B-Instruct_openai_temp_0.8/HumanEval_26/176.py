```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The list with duplicates removed.

    Example:
        >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
        [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    
    return result

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all duplicates removed, while preserving the original order. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers that have been encountered so far, and appends each number to the result list only if it has not been seen before. The function is then tested with the provided example.
