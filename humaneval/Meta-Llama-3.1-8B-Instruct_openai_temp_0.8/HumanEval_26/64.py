```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of integers with duplicates removed.

    Example:
        >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
        [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    
    return result

# Test the function
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This script defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input, removes all elements that occur more than once, and returns the resulting list. The function uses a `set` to keep track of seen elements in O(1) time. It then iterates over the input list, adding each unique element to the result list. The test at the end demonstrates the function's behavior with the example input.
