```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    
    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of integers with duplicates removed.
    
    Example:
        >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
        [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in seen:
            result.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    
    return result

# Test the function
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This script uses a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far. When it encounters a new element, it adds it to the result list and the set of seen elements. This way, it efficiently removes duplicates while preserving the order of the elements.
