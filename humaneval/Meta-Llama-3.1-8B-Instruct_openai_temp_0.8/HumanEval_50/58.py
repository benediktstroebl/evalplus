This script encodes a string by shifting every alphabet character by 5 positions in the alphabet and keeps non-alphabet characters unchanged. The `decode_shift` function does the reverse operation to get the original string back. The `isalpha` method is used to check if a character is an alphabet before performing the shift operation. 

Note: The code has been modified to correctly handle the shift operation in the alphabet, and to preserve case by subtracting the ASCII value of "a" before shifting. The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of a character, and `chr` is used to get the character represented by a specific ASCII value. The `% 26` operation is used to handle the wraparound of the alphabet when the shifted character's ASCII value exceeds the limit of the alphabet.
