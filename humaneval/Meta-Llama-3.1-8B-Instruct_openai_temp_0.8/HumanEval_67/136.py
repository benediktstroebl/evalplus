    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.

    Args:
    s (str): A string that contains the total number of apples and oranges in the basket.
    n (int): The total number of fruits in the basket.

    Returns:
    int: The number of mangoes in the basket.

    Example:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) -> 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) -> 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) -> 19

# Example usage:
print(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19))  # Output: 8
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3))  # Output: 2
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100))  # Output: 95
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120))  # Output: 19
```

Please note that the regular expression used in the code above (`re.findall(r'\d+', s)`) assumes that there are exactly three numbers in the string. If the input string can have a different format (e.g., multiple numbers or different words), the regular expression may need to be adjusted accordingly.
