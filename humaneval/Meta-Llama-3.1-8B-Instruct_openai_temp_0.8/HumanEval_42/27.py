```python
def incr_list(l: list) -> list:
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    
    # Use list comprehension to increment each element in the list by 1
    # The expression `i + 1` for each element `i` in the list `l`
    incremented_list = [i + 1 for i in l]
    
    # Return the incremented list
    return incremented_list

# Example usage:
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])) 
# Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```

However, It's worth noting that Python's official documentation discourages the use of type hints for mutable objects like lists in function parameters, due to the mutable default argument problem. 

Here is the improved version:

```python
def incr_list(lst):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1."""
    
    # Use list comprehension to increment each element in the list by 1
    # The expression `i + 1` for each element `i` in the list `lst`
    return [i + 1 for i in lst]

# Example usage:
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])) 
# Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
