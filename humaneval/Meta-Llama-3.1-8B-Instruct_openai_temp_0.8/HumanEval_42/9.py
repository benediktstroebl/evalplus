```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """
    Return list with elements incremented by 1.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with elements incremented by 1.

    Example:
        >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
        [2, 3, 4]
        >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
        [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    return [x + 1 for x in l]

# Test cases
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))
```

This script uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is incremented by 1. It first defines the `incr_list` function, which takes a list `l` as input, and then uses a list comprehension to create a new list with elements incremented by 1. Finally, it includes two test cases to verify that the function is working correctly.
