```python
def incr_list(l: list) -> list:
    """
    Return list with elements incremented by 1.

    Args:
        l (list): Input list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: List with all elements incremented by 1.
    """
    return [i + 1 for i in l]

# Test cases
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: [2, 3, 4]
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Expected output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```

This script uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the corresponding element in the input list plus 1. This approach is concise and efficient, making it suitable for a production environment.
