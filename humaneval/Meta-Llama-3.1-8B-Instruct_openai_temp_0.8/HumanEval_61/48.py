This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of parentheses as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets it has seen, and returns `False` as soon as it encounters a closing bracket without an opening bracket. If it finishes iterating over the string without finding any issues, it returns `True`. The script also includes test cases to verify that the function works correctly.
