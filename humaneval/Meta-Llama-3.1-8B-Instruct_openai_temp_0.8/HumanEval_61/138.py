This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets it encounters. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack, effectively matching the closing bracket with an opening bracket. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, that means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, that means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
