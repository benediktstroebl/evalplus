This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of parentheses as input and checks if every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses. If a closing parenthesis is encountered when the stack is empty, the function immediately returns `False`. If the stack is empty after checking all parentheses, the function returns `True`, indicating that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
