This script uses a stack-like approach to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets. It iterates over the string, incrementing the balance for each opening bracket and decrementing it for each closing bracket. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it returns False. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the balance is zero, which means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
