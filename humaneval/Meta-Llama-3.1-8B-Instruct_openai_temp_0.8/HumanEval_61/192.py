This script implements the `correct_bracketing` function according to the provided specification. It uses a counter to keep track of the balance of opening and closing brackets. If the balance ever becomes negative or is non-zero at the end of the string, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The test cases at the end are used to verify the correctness of the function.
