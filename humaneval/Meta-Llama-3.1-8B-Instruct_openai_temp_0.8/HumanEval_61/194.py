This script uses a simple counter to keep track of open brackets, decrementing it for every closing bracket and checking for negative values to ensure that every closing bracket has a corresponding opening one. It then checks the final value of the counter to ensure that there are no opening brackets without a closing one. If all checks pass, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
