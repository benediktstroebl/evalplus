This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a balance counter to keep track of the difference between the number of opening and closing brackets. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. If the balance is zero at the end, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`.
