This script uses a stack-like approach where we increment a counter `balance` whenever we encounter an opening bracket and decrement it whenever we encounter a closing bracket. If at any point the counter becomes negative, we know that there's an extra closing bracket, so we return False. Finally, we check if the balance is zero after iterating over the entire string. If it's not, we know that there are unmatched brackets, so we return False. Otherwise, we return True to indicate that the brackets are correctly balanced.
