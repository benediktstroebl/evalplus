### Correct Bracketing Checker
#### Python Script
```markdown
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the input string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of '(' and ')'.

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.

This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets in the input string. It iterates over each character in the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when corresponding closing brackets are encountered. If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
