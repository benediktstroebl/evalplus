This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns False. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
