```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string containing only "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    opening_brackets = 0  # Initialize a counter for opening brackets
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":  # If we encounter an opening bracket, increment the counter
            opening_brackets += 1
        elif bracket == ")":  # If we encounter a closing bracket
            if opening_brackets == 0:  # If there are no opening brackets left, return False
                return False
            opening_brackets -= 1  # Decrement the counter for opening brackets
    return opening_brackets == 0  # After checking all brackets, return whether the counter is zero

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```

However, there's a more Pythonic way to solve this problem by using a stack data structure. We can push every opening bracket onto the stack and pop every closing bracket. If there are any brackets left on the stack at the end, it means there are unmatched opening brackets.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string containing only "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":  # If we encounter an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":  # If we encounter a closing bracket
            if not stack:  # If the stack is empty, return False
                return False
            stack.pop()  # If the stack is not empty, pop the last opening bracket
    return not stack  # After checking all brackets, return whether the stack is empty

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```
