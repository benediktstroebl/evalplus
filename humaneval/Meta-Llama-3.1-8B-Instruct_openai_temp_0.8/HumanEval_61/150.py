This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is not empty. If it's not empty, it pops the last opening bracket from the stack, effectively matching the opening and closing brackets. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns False, indicating that there is no matching opening bracket. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string. If it's empty, it returns True, indicating that all opening brackets have been matched. If it's not empty, it returns False, indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets.
