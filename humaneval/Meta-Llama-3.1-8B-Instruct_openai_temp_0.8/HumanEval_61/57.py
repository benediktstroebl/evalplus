This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it immediately returns `False`. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns `False`.
