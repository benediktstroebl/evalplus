```python

    """
    This function checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:

    Returns:

    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack

    for bracket in brackets:

Alternatively, you can use a more concise version of the function using Python's built-in `all()` function and a generator expression:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    return all(stack.pop() == "(" if bracket == ")" else bracket for bracket in brackets for stack in ([],) if not bracket == ")")

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing(")(())"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing(""))  # True
```
