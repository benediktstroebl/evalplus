This Python script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string, pushing each opening bracket onto the stack and popping it off whenever it encounters a closing bracket. If there are any remaining opening brackets (i.e., the stack is not empty) at the end of the string, it means that there was no corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
