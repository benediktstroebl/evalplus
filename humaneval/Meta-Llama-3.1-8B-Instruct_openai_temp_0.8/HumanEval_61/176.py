```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:

    Checks if every opening bracket in the string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.

    Examples:

        False

This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns False. If the stack is not empty after iterating over the string, it also returns False. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that all brackets are correctly paired.
