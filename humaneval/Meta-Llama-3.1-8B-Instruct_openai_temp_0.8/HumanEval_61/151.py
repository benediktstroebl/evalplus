This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the string. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element (which is an opening bracket). After iterating through the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
