### Correct Bracketing Validator
#### A Python Script to Check if Every Opening Bracket has a Corresponding Closing Bracket

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validate if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of opening brackets
    opening_brackets = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, increment the counter
        if bracket == "(":
            opening_brackets += 1
        # If the character is a closing bracket, decrement the counter
        elif bracket == ")":
            # If there are no opening brackets to match, return False
            if opening_brackets == 0:
                return False
            # Otherwise, decrement the counter
            opening_brackets -= 1
    
    # If there are any remaining opening brackets, return False
    # Otherwise, return True (every opening bracket was closed)
    return opening_brackets == 0

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False

    print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```

This script utilizes a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered. When a closing bracket is found, the counter is decremented. If the counter becomes zero (indicating all opening brackets were matched), the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This approach efficiently checks the bracketing in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string.
