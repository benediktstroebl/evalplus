This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping corresponding opening brackets from the stack when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns `False`, indicating that there's no corresponding opening bracket. Finally, it returns `True` if the stack is empty after processing all brackets, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
