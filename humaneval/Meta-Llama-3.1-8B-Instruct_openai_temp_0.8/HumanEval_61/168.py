### Correct Bracketing Checker

#### Description
This Python script checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string.

#### Code
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    """
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty
        elif bracket == ")":
            # If the stack is empty, return False because there's no matching opening bracket
            if not stack:
                return False
            # If the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
            else:
                stack.pop()
    
    # After iterating over the entire string, return True if the stack is empty
    # This means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket
    # Otherwise, return False
    return not stack

# Example use cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(("))  # False
```

This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the string, if it's an opening bracket, it's pushed onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, the script checks if the stack is empty (meaning there's no matching opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. Finally, the script returns True if the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, indicating every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket.
