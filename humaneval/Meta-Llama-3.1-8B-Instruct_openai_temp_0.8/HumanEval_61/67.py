### Correct Bracketing Script
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack

    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":  # If the bracket is an opening bracket
            stack.append(bracket)  # Push it onto the stack
        elif bracket == ")":  # If the bracket is a closing bracket
            if not stack:  # If the stack is empty (no matching opening bracket)
                return False  # Return False
            stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket from the stack

    return not stack  # Return True if the stack is empty (all brackets matched), False otherwise


# Example usage:
if correct_bracketing("("):
    print("False")
if correct_bracketing("()"):
    print("True")
if correct_bracketing("(()())"):
    print("True")
if correct_bracketing(")(()")):
    print("False")
```
This script uses a stack data structure to solve the problem. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when a matching closing bracket is found. If a closing bracket is encountered when the stack is empty, the function returns False, indicating that there's no matching opening bracket. If the stack is empty at the end of the function, it means all brackets were matched correctly, so the function returns True.
