This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After checking all brackets, it returns `True` if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket) and `False` otherwise.
