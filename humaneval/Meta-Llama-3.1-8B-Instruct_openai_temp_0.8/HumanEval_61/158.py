### Correct Bracketing Script

#### Problem Description
The following Python script checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

#### Code
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in a string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """

    # Initialize a stack to store opening brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
        elif bracket == ")" and stack:
            stack.pop()
        # If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is empty, return False
        elif bracket == ")":
            return False

    # If the stack is empty after iterating over the string, return True; otherwise, return False
    return not stack

#### Example Use Cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing(")()()("))  # False
```

#### Explanation
This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets in the string. It iterates over each character in the string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty, it returns False because there is no corresponding opening bracket. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
