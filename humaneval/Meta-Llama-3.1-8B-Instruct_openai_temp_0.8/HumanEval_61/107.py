This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no matching opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False.
