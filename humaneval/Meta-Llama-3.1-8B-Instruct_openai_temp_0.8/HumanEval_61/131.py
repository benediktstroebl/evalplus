In this script, we use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets we've seen so far. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return False because there's no corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return True; otherwise, we return False.
