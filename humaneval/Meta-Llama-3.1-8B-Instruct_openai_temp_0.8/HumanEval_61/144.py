This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it immediately returns False because there is no matching opening bracket. After checking all brackets, it returns True if the stack is empty (meaning all brackets were matched) and False otherwise.
