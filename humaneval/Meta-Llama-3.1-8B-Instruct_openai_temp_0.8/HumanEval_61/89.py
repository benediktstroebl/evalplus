This script solves the problem by using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over each character in the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If it ever encounters a closing bracket with no corresponding opening bracket (i.e., the stack is empty), it immediately returns False. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string (implying every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise.
