### Correct Bracketing Validation
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validate if a given string of brackets has correct bracketing.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string containing only "(" and ")".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.

    Example:
    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
    return not stack


# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(correct_bracketing("("))   # False
    print(correct_bracketing("()"))   # True

    print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))   # False
```
This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is not empty (i.e., there's a corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is empty, it immediately returns False, as there's no matching opening bracket. After processing all brackets, it returns True if the stack is empty (meaning all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets), and False otherwise.
