This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. Whenever it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's empty, there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty at the end. If it's empty, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True.
