### Correct Bracketing Function
#### Problem Statement
Write a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "(" and ")" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Otherwise, return `False`.

#### Solution
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty
        elif bracket == ")":
            # If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so return False
            if not stack:
                return False
            # If the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
            else:
                stack.pop()

    # After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so return True
    # If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so return False
    return not stack

# Example use cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("())"))  # False
```

In this solution, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so we return False. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so we return False.
