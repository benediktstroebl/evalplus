This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (indicating no matching opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty after processing all brackets, indicating correct bracketing.
