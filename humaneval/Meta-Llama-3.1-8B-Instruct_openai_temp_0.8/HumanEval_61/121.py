In this script, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return False because there's no corresponding opening bracket for this closing bracket. Otherwise, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return True because every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so we return False.
