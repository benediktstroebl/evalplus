In this script, we use a stack to store opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty (which would indicate no matching opening bracket). If it's not empty, we pop the matching opening bracket from the stack. Finally, we return True if the stack is empty (meaning all brackets were correctly paired) and False otherwise.
