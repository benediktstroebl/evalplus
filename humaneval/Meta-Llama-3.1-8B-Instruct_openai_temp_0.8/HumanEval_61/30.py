This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (i.e., there is no matching opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket).
