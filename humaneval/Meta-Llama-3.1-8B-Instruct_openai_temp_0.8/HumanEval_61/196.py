This script uses a simple counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered so far. When it encounters a closing bracket, it decrements the counter. If it encounters a closing bracket when the counter is 0, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so it returns False. If it finishes iterating over the string and the counter is not 0, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
