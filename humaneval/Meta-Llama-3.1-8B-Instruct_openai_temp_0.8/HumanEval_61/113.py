This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "(" and ")" as input. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered so far. When it encounters a closing bracket, it decrements the counter. If the counter reaches 0 at any point, it means there was no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. If the counter is not 0 after iterating over the entire string, it means there were unpaired opening brackets, so the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
