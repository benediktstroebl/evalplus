However, the above solution still doesn't cover the edge case of an empty string as a non-empty string of brackets with a balance of zero. So, we can modify the condition to check if the input string is empty or not and return True for an empty string because there are no brackets to check for.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Check if every opening bracket in the input string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # If the input string is empty, return True as there are no brackets to check for
    if not brackets:
        return True
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets
    balance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, increment the balance
        if bracket == "(":
            balance += 1
        # If the character is a closing bracket, decrement the balance
        elif bracket == ")":
            balance -= 1
            # If the balance is negative at this point, it means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket
            if balance < 0:
                return False
    
    # After iterating over the entire string, if the balance is still zero, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
    return balance == 0
