This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of "(" and ")" as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, or if there are any opening brackets left on the stack at the end, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
