This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets that have been seen but not yet closed. If the counter becomes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. If the counter is not zero after iterating over the entire string, it means there are opening brackets without a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`.
