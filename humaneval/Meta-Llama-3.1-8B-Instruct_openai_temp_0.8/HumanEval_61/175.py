This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. For each opening bracket encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. For each closing bracket encountered, it is checked if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If it is not empty, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If it is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns False.
