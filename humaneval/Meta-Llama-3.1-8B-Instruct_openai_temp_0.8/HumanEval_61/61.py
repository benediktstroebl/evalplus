This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. It iterates over each character in the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when a corresponding closing bracket is found. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `False`.
