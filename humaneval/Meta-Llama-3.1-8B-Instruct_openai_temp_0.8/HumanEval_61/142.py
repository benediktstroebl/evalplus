This script uses a simple counter-based approach to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets. It iterates over the input string, incrementing the balance when it encounters an opening bracket and decrementing it when it encounters a closing bracket. If the balance becomes negative at any point, it means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening one, so the function returns False. If the balance is not zero after iterating over all characters, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
