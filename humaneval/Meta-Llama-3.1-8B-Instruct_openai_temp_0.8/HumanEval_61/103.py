This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of parentheses as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a simple counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not yet been matched with a closing bracket. The function iterates over each character in the input string, incrementing the counter for opening brackets and decrementing it for closing brackets. If the counter ever reaches 0 when we encounter a closing bracket, we return `False`, indicating that there's no matching opening bracket. Finally, we check if there are any remaining opening brackets after iterating over the entire string. If there are, we return `False`; otherwise, we return `True`.
