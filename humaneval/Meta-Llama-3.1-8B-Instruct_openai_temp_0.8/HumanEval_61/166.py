This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if there's a corresponding opening bracket on the stack. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty at the end; if it is, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True.
