### Correct Bracketing Function
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if the brackets are correctly paired, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a stack to store the opening brackets
    opening_brackets = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "(":
            opening_brackets.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty
        elif bracket == ")":

```
This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets in the input string. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns False. After iterating over the entire string, it returns True if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were correctly paired) and False otherwise. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
