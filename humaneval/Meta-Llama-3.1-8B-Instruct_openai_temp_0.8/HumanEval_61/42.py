This script uses a stack-based approach to solve the problem. It iterates through the string of brackets, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping the corresponding closing bracket from the stack when encountered. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, or if there are remaining opening brackets in the stack after iterating through all brackets, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
