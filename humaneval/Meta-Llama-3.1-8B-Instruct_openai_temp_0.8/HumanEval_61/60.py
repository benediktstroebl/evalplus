This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets that haven't been closed yet. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element off the stack. After checking all the brackets, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, that means there are some opening brackets that haven't been closed yet, so the function returns False.
