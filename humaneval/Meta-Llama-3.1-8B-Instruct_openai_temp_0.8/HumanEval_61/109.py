This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the string. For each closing bracket encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket) or pops the opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty after processing the entire string, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets, and the function returns False.
