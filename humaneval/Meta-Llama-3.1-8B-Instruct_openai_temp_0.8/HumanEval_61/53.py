This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (i.e., no matching opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, it pops the matching opening bracket from the stack. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty (i.e., all brackets are matched), False otherwise.
