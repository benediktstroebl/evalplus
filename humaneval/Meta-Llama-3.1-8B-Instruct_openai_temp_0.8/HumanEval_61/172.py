This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. If a closing bracket is encountered while the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so we return False. If we encounter a closing bracket when the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. At the end, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True. Otherwise, we return False.
