This script defines the `correct_bracketing` function that checks if every opening bracket in the input string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. For each closing bracket, it checks if the stack is not empty and pops the opening bracket from the stack if it's not empty. If the stack is empty when it encounters a closing bracket, it returns False. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
