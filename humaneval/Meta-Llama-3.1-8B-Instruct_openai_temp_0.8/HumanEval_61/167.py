This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets we have seen so far. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is not empty. If it's not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack, which means we have found a corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so we return False.

Finally, after iterating through the entire string, we check if there are still any opening brackets in the stack. If there are, it means they don't have corresponding closing brackets, so we return False. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True.
