This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if there's a corresponding opening bracket in the stack. If there is, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. If there's no corresponding opening bracket (i.e., the stack is empty), it immediately returns False. After iterating through all brackets, it returns False if there are any opening brackets left in the stack (which means they weren't matched with a closing bracket) and True otherwise.
