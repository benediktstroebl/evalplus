This Python script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket. If not, or if the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket), the function returns False. If the function finishes checking all brackets and the stack is empty, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
