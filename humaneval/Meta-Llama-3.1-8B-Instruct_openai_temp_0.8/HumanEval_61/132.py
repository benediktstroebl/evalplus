This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty, which means there's no corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If it's not, there's at least one opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket.
