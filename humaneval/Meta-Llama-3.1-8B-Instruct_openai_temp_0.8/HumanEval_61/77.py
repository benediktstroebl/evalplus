This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It pushes opening brackets onto the stack and pops them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty after iterating over the string, meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
