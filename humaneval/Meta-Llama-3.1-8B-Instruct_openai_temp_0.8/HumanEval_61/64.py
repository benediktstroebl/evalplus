### Correct Bracketing Problem Solver

#### Problem Statement

Solve a problem where a given string of brackets contains both opening and closing brackets. Return `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

#### Solution

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if every opening bracket in a given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack to store the opening brackets

    for bracket in brackets:  # Iterate over each character in the string
        if bracket == "(":  # If the character is an opening bracket
            stack.append(bracket)  # Push it onto the stack
        elif bracket == ")":  # If the character is a closing bracket
            if not stack:  # If the stack is empty
                return False  # There's no corresponding opening bracket, so return False
            stack.pop()  # If the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket

    return not stack  # If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, return True
```

#### Example Usage

```python
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()}")) # False
print(correct_bracketing(")(("))  # False
```
This script defines a function called `correct_bracketing` that checks if a given string of brackets has correct bracketing. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function iterates over each character in the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns `False`. Finally, it returns `not stack`, which is `True` if the stack is empty and `False` otherwise.
