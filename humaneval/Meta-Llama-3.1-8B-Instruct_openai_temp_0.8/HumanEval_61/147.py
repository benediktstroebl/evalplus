This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False.
