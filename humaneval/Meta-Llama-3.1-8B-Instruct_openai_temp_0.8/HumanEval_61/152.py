This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the string, if the stack is empty, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True.
