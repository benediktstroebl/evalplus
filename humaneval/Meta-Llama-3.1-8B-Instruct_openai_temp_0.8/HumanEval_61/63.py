This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it returns False because there's no corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, after iterating over the string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False.
