### Correct Bracketing Checker
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the input string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket in the input string has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket, it returns `False`. If it has processed all brackets and the stack is empty, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
