This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. For each bracket in the input string, if it's an opening bracket, it's pushed to the stack, and if it's a closing bracket, it's popped from the stack if the stack is not empty. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty after iterating through all brackets. If the stack is empty, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
