This script uses a stack data structure to solve the problem. It iterates over the input string of brackets, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, or if there are any brackets left on the stack after processing the entire string, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
