This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. It pushes opening brackets onto the stack and pops them when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, or there are remaining opening brackets in the stack after checking all brackets, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.
