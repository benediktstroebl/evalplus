This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets in the string. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it immediately returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it checks the stack. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
