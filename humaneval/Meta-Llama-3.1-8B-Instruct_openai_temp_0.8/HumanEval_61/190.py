This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it removes the last opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
