This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no corresponding opening bracket, so we return False. If the stack is not empty, we pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. Finally, we check if the stack is empty after processing all brackets. If it is, every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True. If the stack is not empty, there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so we return False.
