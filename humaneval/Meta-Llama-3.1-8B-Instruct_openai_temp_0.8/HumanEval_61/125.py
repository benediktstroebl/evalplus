In this script, we use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets we've encountered. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is not empty. If it's not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack, effectively matching the closing bracket with the opening bracket. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has been matched with a closing bracket, so we return True. Otherwise, we return False.
