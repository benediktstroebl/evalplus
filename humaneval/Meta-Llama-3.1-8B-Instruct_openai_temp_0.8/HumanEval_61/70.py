This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets in the input string. It iterates through the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when a corresponding closing bracket is encountered. If a closing bracket is encountered when the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so the function returns False. After processing all brackets, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns False.
