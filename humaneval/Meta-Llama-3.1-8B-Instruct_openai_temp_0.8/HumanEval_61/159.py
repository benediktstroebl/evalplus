This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (in which case there's no corresponding opening bracket) or pops the opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty, which means all brackets were correctly paired.
