This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if there's a matching opening bracket on the stack. If there's no matching opening bracket, it immediately returns False. After processing all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
