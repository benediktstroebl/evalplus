This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no matching opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, if the stack is empty, every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
