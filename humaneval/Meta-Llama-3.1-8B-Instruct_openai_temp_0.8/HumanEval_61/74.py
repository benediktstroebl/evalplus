This script works by using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. Whenever it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. Whenever it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False because there are unmatched opening brackets.
