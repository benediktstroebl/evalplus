This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it tries to pop the opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty when it encounters a closing bracket, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True.
