### Correct Bracketing Checker
#### A Python function to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a stack to store opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        # If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, pop the opening bracket from the stack
        elif bracket == ")" and stack:
            stack.pop()
        # If the character is a closing bracket and the stack is empty, return False because there's no corresponding opening bracket
        elif bracket == ")":
            return False
    
    # If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, return True. Otherwise, return False because there are unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack


# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```

This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. It iterates over each character in the input string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty, it immediately returns False because there's no corresponding opening bracket. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string. If it's empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False because there are unmatched opening brackets.
