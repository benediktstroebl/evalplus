### Correct Bracketing Checker
#### Python Script
```markdown
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket in the given string has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
    brackets (str): A string consisting of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
    bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```
This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty (which would mean there's no corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack to match it with the closing bracket. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty at the end of the string, which means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
