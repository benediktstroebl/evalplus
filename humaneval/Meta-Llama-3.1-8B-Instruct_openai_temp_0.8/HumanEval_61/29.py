### Correct Bracketing Problem Solution
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack

    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            # Push opening bracket onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            # If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket,
            # there's no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket
            if not stack or stack.pop()!= "(":
                return False

    # If the stack is empty after iterating through all brackets, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
    return not stack
