This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a counter to keep track of the balance of opening and closing brackets, and returns `False` as soon as it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket. If the function completes iterating over the entire string without finding any closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets, it returns the balance (which should be zero if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket).
