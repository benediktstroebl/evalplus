This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, the script checks if there's an opening bracket at the top of the stack. If there is, it's popped; otherwise, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. After processing all brackets, the function returns True if the stack is empty (meaning all opening brackets have been closed) and False otherwise.
