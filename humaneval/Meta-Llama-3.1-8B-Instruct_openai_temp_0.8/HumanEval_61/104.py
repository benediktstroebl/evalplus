This script uses a stack-based approach to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when encountering matching closing brackets. If a closing bracket is encountered before a matching opening bracket or after all opening brackets have been closed, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True if the stack is empty after processing all brackets.
