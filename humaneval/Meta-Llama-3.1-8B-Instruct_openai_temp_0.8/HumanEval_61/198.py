This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there is no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After processing all the brackets, the function returns True if the stack is empty (meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) and False otherwise.
