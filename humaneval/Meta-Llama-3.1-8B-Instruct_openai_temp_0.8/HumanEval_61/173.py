This script uses a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, the counter is decremented. If the counter is zero when a closing bracket is encountered, or if there are any remaining opening brackets at the end of the string, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
