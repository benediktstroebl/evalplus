This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it pops the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. If the stack becomes empty at any point, it means every opening bracket has been matched with a closing bracket. The function returns False if the stack is not empty at the end or if a closing bracket is encountered when the stack is empty.
