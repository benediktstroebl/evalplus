This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the stack is checked to see if it is empty. If it is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, the opening bracket at the top of the stack is popped. After iterating over the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns False.
