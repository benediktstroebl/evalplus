This function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no matching opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket, so it returns True.
