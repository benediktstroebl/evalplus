This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there was no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the matching opening bracket from the stack. After processing all brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's empty, every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True.
