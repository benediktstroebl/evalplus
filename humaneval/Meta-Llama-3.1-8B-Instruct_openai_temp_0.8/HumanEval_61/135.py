This script uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, then there's no matching opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the matching opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is empty, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
