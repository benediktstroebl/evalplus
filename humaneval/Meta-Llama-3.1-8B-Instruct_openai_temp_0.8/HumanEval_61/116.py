### Correct Bracketing Problem Solution
#### Problem Description:
The function `correct_bracketing` takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

#### Solution:
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> correct_bracketing("(")
        False
        >>> correct_bracketing("()")
        True
        >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
        True
        >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
        False
    """
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of opening brackets
    opening_brackets = 0

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, increment the counter
        if bracket == "(":
            opening_brackets += 1
        # If the character is a closing bracket, decrement the counter
        elif bracket == ")":
            # If there are no opening brackets to match, return False
            if opening_brackets == 0:
                return False
            opening_brackets -= 1

    # If there are any remaining opening brackets, return False
    if opening_brackets!= 0:
        return False

    # If the function has not returned False by now, all brackets are correctly paired
    return True
```

#### Example Usage:
```python
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```
```
