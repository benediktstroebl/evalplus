This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise. It uses a counter to keep track of the opening brackets and iterates over the string to determine the result. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior for various inputs.
