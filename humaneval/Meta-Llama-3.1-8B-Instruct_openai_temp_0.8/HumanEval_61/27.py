### Correct Bracketing Python Script
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    """
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False  # Unbalanced bracket, no corresponding opening bracket
            stack.pop()
    return not stack  # If stack is empty, all brackets were balanced

# Example usage
if correct_bracketing("("):
    print("False")
if correct_bracketing("()"):

if correct_bracketing("(()())"):
    print("True")
if correct_bracketing(")(()"):
    print("False")
```
This Python script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty, in which case it immediately returns `False` because there is no corresponding opening bracket. After processing all brackets, it returns whether the stack is empty or not, which indicates whether all brackets were balanced.
