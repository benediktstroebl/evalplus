This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack is empty after iterating over the entire string, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.
