This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function uses a counter `balance` to keep track of the difference between the number of opening and closing brackets encountered. If the balance is ever negative (i.e., there's no corresponding opening bracket for a closing bracket), the function immediately returns `False`. If the balance is 0 at the end of the string, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
