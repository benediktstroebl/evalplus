This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string of brackets. It uses a stack data structure to track the opening brackets and their corresponding closing brackets. If the stack is empty after checking all brackets, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
