This script uses a stack data structure to efficiently keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when a closing bracket is encountered. If the stack is empty after iterating through the string, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
