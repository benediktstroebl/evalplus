### Correct Bracketing Problem

#### Solution

Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of "(" and ")".

    Returns:
        bool: True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of opening brackets
    opening_brackets = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, increment the counter
        if bracket == "(":
            opening_brackets += 1
        # If the character is a closing bracket, decrement the counter
        elif bracket == ")":
            # If there are no opening brackets to match, return False
            if opening_brackets == 0:
                return False
            opening_brackets -= 1
    
    # If there are still opening brackets left, return False
    if opening_brackets!= 0:
        return False
    
    # If there are no unmatched opening brackets, return True
    return True


# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```

#### Explanation

This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of parentheses as input. It iterates over each character in the string and keeps track of the number of opening brackets encountered using a counter. When a closing bracket is encountered, the counter is decremented. If there are no opening brackets to match a closing bracket, the function returns `False`. Finally, the function checks if there are any unmatched opening brackets left at the end and returns `False` if so, and `True` otherwise.
