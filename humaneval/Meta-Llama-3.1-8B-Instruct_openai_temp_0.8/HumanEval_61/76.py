This script uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It pushes every opening bracket onto the stack and pops the opening bracket from the stack when a closing bracket is encountered. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, or if there are unmatched opening brackets at the end of the string, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
