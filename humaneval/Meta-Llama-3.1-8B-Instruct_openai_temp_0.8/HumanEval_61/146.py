This script defines a function `correct_bracketing` that uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string of brackets, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when a closing bracket is encountered. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns `False`. After iterating over the entire string, it returns `True` if the stack is empty (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket) and `False` otherwise. The test cases are included at the end to verify the correctness of the function.
