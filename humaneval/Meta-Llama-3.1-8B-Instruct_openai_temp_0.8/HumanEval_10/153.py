```

This code uses a simple algorithm to extend a given string into the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string. It finds the longest common prefix between the string and its reverse, and then appends the reverse of the string prefix to the end to form the palindrome. The `make_palindrome` function and its docstring remain faithful to the original specification, with added example usage to illustrate how to use the function and the `is_palindrome` function.
