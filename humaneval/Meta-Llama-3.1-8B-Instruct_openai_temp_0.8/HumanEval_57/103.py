### Monotonic List Checker
#### Overview

This Python script defines a function `monotonic` which checks if the elements in a given list are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

#### Code
```python
def monotonic(l: list) -> bool:
    """
    Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    
    Args:
    l (list): The input list to be checked.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Check if the list has less than 2 elements
    if len(l) < 2:
        # If the list has less than 2 elements, it's considered monotic
        return True
    
    # Check if the list is increasing
    increasing = all(l[i] <= l[i + 1] for i in range(len(l) - 1))
    
    # Check if the list is decreasing
    decreasing = all(l[i] >= l[i + 1] for i in range(len(l) - 1))
    
    # Return True if the list is either increasing or decreasing
    return increasing or decreasing

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Expected output: True
    print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Expected output: False
    print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # Expected output: True
    print(monotonic([1, 1, 1]))  # Expected output: True
    print(monotonic([1]))  # Expected output: True
```

#### Explanation

The `monotonic` function takes a list `l` as input and checks if its elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing using two variables: `increasing` and `decreasing`.

The `increasing` variable checks if all elements in the list are less than or equal to their next elements using the `all()` function and a generator expression.

The `decreasing` variable checks if all elements in the list are greater than or equal to their next elements using the `all()` function and a generator expression.

Finally, the function returns `True` if the list is either increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.
