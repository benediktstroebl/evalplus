This script uses a simple iterative approach to check the monotonicity of the list. It initializes two flags `increasing` and `decreasing` to track the monotonicity of the list. If the list is increasing, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one. If the list is decreasing, it checks if the current element is less than or equal to the previous one. If the list fails to meet either of these conditions, it sets the corresponding flag to `False`. Finally, it returns `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.
