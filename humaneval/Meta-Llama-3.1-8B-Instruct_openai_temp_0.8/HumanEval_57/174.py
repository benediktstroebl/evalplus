### Monotonic ListValidator

Below is a Python script that defines a function to validate if a list of elements is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

```markdown
### Code

```python
def monotonic(l: list) -> bool:
    """
    Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

    Args:
    l (list): A list of elements.

    Returns:
    bool: True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, False otherwise.
    """
    return all(l[i] <= l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1)) or all(l[i] >= l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1))


# Example usage:
# Test case 1: Monotonically increasing
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Expected output: True

# Test case 2: Not monotonically increasing
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Expected output: False

# Test case 3: Monotonically decreasing
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # Expected output: True
```
### Explanation

This script defines a function `monotonic(l)` that takes a list `l` as input. The function uses the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

- The expression `l[i] <= l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1)` checks if all elements are monotonically increasing.
- The expression `l[i] >= l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1)` checks if all elements are monotonically decreasing.

The `or` operator is used to return `True` if either of these conditions is met.

The example usage section demonstrates how to use the `monotonic(l)` function with different test cases to validate its correctness.
