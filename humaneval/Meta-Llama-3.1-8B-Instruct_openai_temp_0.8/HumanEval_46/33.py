    Compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence.

    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence.

This script defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence using an iterative approach. It initializes the first four elements of the sequence and then iteratively updates the last four elements to compute the nth element. The function includes input validation and returns the computed element.

The provided test cases demonstrate the function's correctness by computing the 5th, 6th, and 7th elements of the Fib4 number sequence.
