    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence 
    that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element in the sequence to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The nth element in the Fib4 number sequence.

This Python script defines a function `fib4(n)` to compute the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence. It uses an iterative approach to avoid the recursion used in the original definition. This script also includes a docstring with examples to illustrate how to use the function and a test section to verify its correctness.
