### Fib4 Number Sequence
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence 
    that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The position of the number in the sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The nth number in the Fib4 sequence.

This script defines the `fib4` function, which uses an iterative approach to compute the nth number in the Fib4 sequence without using recursion. It first checks the base cases and then initializes a list to store the sequence. The sequence is computed using a loop, and the function returns the nth number in the sequence. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
