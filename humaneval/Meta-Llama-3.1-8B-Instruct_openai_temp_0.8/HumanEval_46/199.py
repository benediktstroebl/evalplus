    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    This function efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence without using recursion.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The position of the element in the fib4 sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The n-th element of the fib4 sequence.

This Python script defines a function `fib4(n)` that efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. It uses iteration instead of recursion to compute the sequence, and handles edge cases to ensure the function works correctly for all inputs. The script includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
