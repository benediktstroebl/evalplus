### Fibonacci-like Sequence: Fib4 Number
#### Efficient Computation Using Dynamic Programming

```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence 
    that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    Args:
    n (int): The position of the number in the sequence.

    Returns:
    int: The nth number in the Fib4 sequence.

This script uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nth number in the Fib4 sequence. It initializes a list to store the sequence up to the nth number and then iteratively calculates the next numbers in the sequence by summing the previous four numbers. The script handles edge cases and returns the nth number in the sequence.
