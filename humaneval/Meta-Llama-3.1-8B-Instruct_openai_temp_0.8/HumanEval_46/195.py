Here's a Python script that efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence without using recursion. This script utilizes memoization to store calculated values and avoid redundant calculations.

# Fib4 Number Sequence Calculator

## Problem Description

The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
- `fib4(0) -> 0`
- `fib4(1) -> 0`
- `fib4(2) -> 2`
- `fib4(3) -> 0`
- `fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`.

## Solution

```python
def fib4(n: int, memo={}):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    Args:
    n (int): The position of the number in the sequence to compute.
    memo (dict, optional): A dictionary to store calculated values for memoization. Defaults to {}.
    
    Returns:
    int: The n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.
    """
    
    # Base cases
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    elif n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Calculate fib4(n) and store the result in the memo dictionary
    memo[n] = fib4(n-1, memo) + fib4(n-2, memo) + fib4(n-3, memo) + fib4(n-4, memo)
    
    return memo[n]
```

## Example Use Cases

```python
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

This script uses a dictionary called `memo` to store the calculated values. It checks if a value is already calculated before computing it, which significantly improves performance for large `n`. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n).
