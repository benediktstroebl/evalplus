Here's a Python script that uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence:
```markdown
# fib4.py

def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence
    that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    This function efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence
    without using recursion.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        # Base cases for the loop initialization
        fib4_0, fib4_1, fib4_2, fib4_3 = 0, 0, 2, 0
        
        # Compute the fib4 sequence up to the n-th number
        for _ in range(3, n + 1):
            fib4_n = fib4_0 + fib4_1 + fib4_2 + fib4_3
            fib4_0, fib4_1, fib4_2, fib4_3 = fib4_1, fib4_2, fib4_3, fib4_n
        
        return fib4_n


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage:
    print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
    print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
    print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```
The provided script uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence efficiently. It initializes the base cases for the loop, where `fib4_0`, `fib4_1`, `fib4_2`, and `fib4_3` are the values of the last four numbers in the sequence. The loop then iteratively computes the next number in the sequence by summing the last four numbers and assigns the result to the next value.

This solution avoids using recursion, making it more memory-efficient for large input values.
