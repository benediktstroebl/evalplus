However, a more efficient way to implement this function is by using dynamic programming. This way we avoid repeating the same calculations for the same values of `i`.

    for _ in range(3, n+1):
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, a + b + c + d
    return d

```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to perform n-2 operations to calculate the nth number in the sequence. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the four variables.
