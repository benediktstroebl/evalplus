This script defines a function `fib4(n)` that efficiently computes the nth element of the fib4 number sequence using an iterative approach with dynamic programming. It initializes an array `fib4_numbers` to store the fib4 numbers up to the nth element, and then iteratively computes the fib4 numbers from `n=3` to `n`. The function returns the nth element of the fib4 number sequence. The script includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
