### Efficient Fibonacci-like Sequence with Dynamic Programming
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the sequence to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The nth element of the Fib4 number sequence.

    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative arguments are not supported")

    # Base cases
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    elif n == 3:
        return 2

    # Initialize an array to store the sequence

    # Compute the sequence using dynamic programming
    for i in range(4, n + 1):

print(fib4(7))  # 14
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to compute the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence. It initializes an array to store the sequence, and then iteratively computes each element using the recurrence relation. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), making it efficient for large inputs.
