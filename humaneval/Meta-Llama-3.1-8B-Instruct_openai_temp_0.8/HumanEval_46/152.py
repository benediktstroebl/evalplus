### Fib4 Number Sequence Calculation
#### Python Implementation

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence.
    
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence 
    that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    Args:
    n (int): The index of the element to calculate in the Fib4 sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The nth element of the Fib4 sequence.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    
    # Create a list to store the calculated elements
    fib4_sequence = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    fib4_sequence[1] = 0
    fib4_sequence[2] = 2
    
    # Calculate the elements from 3 to n
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        fib4_sequence[i] = fib4_sequence[i - 1] + fib4_sequence[i - 2] + fib4_sequence[i - 3] + fib4_sequence[i - 4]
    
    return fib4_sequence[n]


# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
    print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
    print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

This script defines a function `fib4` that uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence. The function first checks for base cases and then calculates the rest of the sequence using a loop. The calculated sequence is stored in a list for efficient access. The script includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
