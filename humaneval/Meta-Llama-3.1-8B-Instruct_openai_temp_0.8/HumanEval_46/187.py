### Efficiently Computing the Fib4 Number Sequence
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    This function efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence using dynamic programming.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position of the element to compute in the fib4 sequence.
    
    Returns:
        int: The n-th element of the fib4 sequence.

    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize a list to store the computed elements
    fib4_sequence = [0]*5
    
    # Base cases
    fib4_sequence[1] = 0
    fib4_sequence[2] = 2
    fib4_sequence[3] = 0
    
    # Compute each element up to the nth position
    for i in range(4, n+1):
        fib4_sequence[i] = fib4_sequence[i-1] + fib4_sequence[i-2] + fib4_sequence[i-3] + fib4_sequence[i-4]

This script defines a function `fib4` to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence using dynamic programming. It initializes a list `fib4_sequence` to store the computed elements and iteratively calculates each element up to the nth position using the recurrence relation. The function returns the nth element of the sequence. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.
