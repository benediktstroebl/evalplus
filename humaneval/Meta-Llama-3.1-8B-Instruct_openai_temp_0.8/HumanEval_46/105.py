def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element in the sequence to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The nth element of the Fib4 number sequence.

    Examples:
        >>> fib4(5)
        4
        >>> fib4(6)
        8
        >>> fib4(7)
        14

    # Handle edge cases
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        # Initialize the first four elements of the sequence
        a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 2, 0

        # Compute the sequence up to the nth element

            a, b, c, d = b, c, d, a + b + c + d

        # Return the nth element

# Example usage
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

This code uses a technique called "loop unrolling" to avoid recursion and compute the nth element of the Fib4 sequence efficiently. It initializes the first four elements of the sequence and then iteratively updates the sequence up to the nth element. The function handles edge cases at the beginning and returns the nth element at the end.
