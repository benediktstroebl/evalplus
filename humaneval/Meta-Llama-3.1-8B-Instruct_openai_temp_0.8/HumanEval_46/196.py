This script defines a function `fib4(n)` that efficiently computes the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence using dynamic programming. It first checks for the base cases (n <= 3) and initializes the sequence with the first four elements. It then fills in the rest of the sequence iteratively, calculating each element as the sum of the previous four elements. The function finally returns the nth element of the sequence. The test cases at the end verify that the function produces the correct results for the given inputs.
