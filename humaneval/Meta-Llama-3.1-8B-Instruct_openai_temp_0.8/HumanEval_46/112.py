### Fib4 Sequence Calculator
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    This function efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence using dynamic programming.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The index of the sequence to compute.
    
    Returns:
    int: The n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.

    # Base cases
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    
    # Create a list to store the sequence
    sequence = [0, 0, 2] + [0]*(n-2)
    
    # Compute the sequence using a for loop
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-3] + sequence[i-4]
    
    # Return the n-th element of the sequence
    return sequence[n]

# Test cases
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14

This script defines a function `fib4(n)` that uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. It creates a list to store the sequence and computes each element using the previous four elements. The function then returns the n-th element of the sequence. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
