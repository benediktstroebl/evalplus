This script uses a iterative approach to build up the sequence, avoiding the recursion that is typically used for Fibonacci-like sequences. The `fib4_sequence` list stores the first `n` elements of the sequence, and we append the next element by adding the previous four elements. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than the O(2^n) complexity of the recursive solution.
