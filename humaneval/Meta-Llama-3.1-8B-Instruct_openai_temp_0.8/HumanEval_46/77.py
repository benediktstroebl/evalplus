This script defines a function `fib4(n)` that efficiently computes the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence. It uses dynamic programming to build up the sequence, storing each term as it is calculated and reusing previously calculated terms to avoid redundant computations. The function handles the base cases and edge cases explicitly, and returns the nth term in the sequence.
