    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    This function efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence without using recursion.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The position of the element in the fib4 sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The value of the n-th element in the fib4 sequence.

This script defines a function `fib4(n)` that efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence without using recursion. It uses a loop to compute the n-th element, and it returns the result. The function also includes input validation to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function.
