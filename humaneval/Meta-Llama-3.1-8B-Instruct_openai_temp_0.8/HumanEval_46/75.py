You can use this function to compute the nth element of the fib4 sequence. The time complexity of this function is O(n), which is more efficient than using recursion. The function initializes a list to store the first four numbers of the fib4 sequence and then iterates from the 4th position to the nth position, calculating each number as the sum of the previous four numbers.
