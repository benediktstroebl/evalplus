### Efficient Calculation of Fib4 Number Sequence

Below is a Python script that calculates the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence efficiently using dynamic programming.

```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence 
    that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    This function efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The position of the element in the sequence.
    
    Returns:
    int: The nth element of the fib4 number sequence.
    """
    
    # Initialize the base cases
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    # Initialize an array to store the sequence
    fib4_sequence = [0, 0, 2]
    
    # Calculate the sequence up to the nth element
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # Calculate the next element using the previous four elements
        next_element = fib4_sequence[i - 1] + fib4_sequence[i - 2] + fib4_sequence[i - 3] + fib4_sequence[i - 4]
        # Append the next element to the sequence
        fib4_sequence.append(next_element)
    
    # Return the nth element of the sequence
    return fib4_sequence[n]

# Test the function
print(fib4(5))  # 4
print(fib4(6))  # 8
print(fib4(7))  # 14
```

In this script, we first initialize the base cases of the Fib4 number sequence. Then, we use a loop to calculate the sequence up to the nth element. We use a list to store the sequence, where the index represents the position of the element in the sequence. In each iteration, we calculate the next element using the previous four elements and append it to the sequence. Finally, we return the nth element of the sequence.

This approach is efficient because it avoids the overhead of function calls and uses a simple loop to iterate over the sequence. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the position of the element in the sequence.
