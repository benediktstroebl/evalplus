### Efficient Computation of Fib4 Number Sequence
#### Using Dynamic Programming with Memoization

The following Python script uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently compute the nth element of the fib4 number sequence.

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Compute the nth element of the fib4 number sequence.

    The fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequence, 
    but with a different recurrence relation: fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The nth element of the fib4 number sequence.

    Example:
        >>> fib4(5)
        4
        >>> fib4(6)
        8
        >>> fib4(7)
        14
    """
    # Base cases
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 2

    # Initialize memoization table
    memo = [0] * (n + 1)
    memo[1] = 0
    memo[2] = 2

    # Fill memoization table using dynamic programming
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2] + memo[i-3] + memo[i-4]

    return memo[n]
```

This script uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization to compute the nth element of the fib4 number sequence. The memoization table `memo` stores the computed elements, and the function iterates from `i = 3` to `n` to fill the table. The base cases are handled explicitly, and the recurrence relation is applied to compute each element.
