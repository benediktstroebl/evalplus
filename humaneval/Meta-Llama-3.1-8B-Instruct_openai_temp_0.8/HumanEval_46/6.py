This script computes the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence using dynamic programming. It first initializes a list to store the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth element, and then uses a loop to fill in the rest of the sequence. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), making it efficient for large values of n.
