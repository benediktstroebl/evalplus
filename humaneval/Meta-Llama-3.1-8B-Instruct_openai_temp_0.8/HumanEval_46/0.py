    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    
    This function efficiently computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence using bottom-up dynamic programming.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The element in the fib4 sequence to compute.
    
    Returns:
    int: The n-th element in the fib4 sequence.

This script uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. The `fib4` function uses a list to store the elements of the sequence as they are computed, allowing it to avoid redundant calculations and reduce the time complexity of the computation. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
