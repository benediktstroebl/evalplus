### Fibonacci-like Sequence: Fib4 Number Sequence
#### Computing the n-th Element Efficiently

We can compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence efficiently using dynamic programming. The idea is to store the results of previously computed elements in a list and reuse them as needed.

```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """
    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence 
    that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the element to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the base cases
    a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 2, 0

    # Compute the n-th element
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        # Update the current element as the sum of the previous four elements
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, a + b + c + d
    
    return d

# Example usage:
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

In this implementation, we use a simple iterative approach to compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence. We store the results of previously computed elements in the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and update them as we iterate through the sequence. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and uses O(1) additional space, making it efficient for large values of n.
