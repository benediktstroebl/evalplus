This script defines a function `fib4(n)` that computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. It uses a list `fib4_numbers` to store the computed fib4 numbers and iteratively computes the numbers from the 4th to the n-th element. The function handles the base cases and edge cases correctly. The test cases at the end verify the correctness of the function.
