    The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

        n (int): The position of the number in the Fib4 sequence.

    Returns:
        int: The nth number in the Fib4 sequence.

This script defines a function `fib4(n)` that computes the nth number in the Fib4 sequence. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the sequence up to the nth number. The function handles edge cases and returns the correct result for the given test cases.
