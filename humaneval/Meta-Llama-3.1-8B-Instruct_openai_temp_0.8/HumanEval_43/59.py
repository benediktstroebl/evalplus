### Pairs Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description

This script checks if there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

#### Code

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if two distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    
    # Create a set from the list to remove duplicates and improve lookup efficiency
    num_set = set(lst)
    
    # Iterate through the set
    for num in num_set:
        # Check if the complement of the current number is in the set
        if -num in num_set:
            # If the complement is found, return True
            return True
            
    # If no pair summing to zero is found, return False
    return False

# Example usage
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script works by iterating through the list and checking if the complement of each number (i.e., the number that would sum to zero when added to it) is also in the list. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) due to the set lookups, where n is the number of distinct elements in the list.
