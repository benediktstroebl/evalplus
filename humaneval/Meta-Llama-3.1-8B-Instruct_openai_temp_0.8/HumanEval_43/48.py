### Pairs Sum to Zero
#### Problem Description

The goal of this script is to determine if there are two distinct elements in a given list of integers that sum to zero.

#### Code
```markdown
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the list contains two distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()  # A set to store the elements we have seen so far.

    for num in lst:
        # For each number in the list, we check if its negative is in the set.
        # If it is, we return True because we have found two distinct elements that sum to zero.
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set.

    # If we have iterated over the entire list and haven't found any pairs that sum to zero, we return False.
    return False


# Test cases
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))   # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script uses a set to store the elements we have seen so far. For each number in the list, we check if its negative is in the set. If it is, we return True because we have found two distinct elements that sum to zero. If we don't find any such pairs after iterating over the entire list, we return False.
