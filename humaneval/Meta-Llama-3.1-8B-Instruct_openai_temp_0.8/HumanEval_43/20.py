### Pairs Sum to Zero
#### Python Function to Check if Two Elements in a List Sum to Zero

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    It returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if two distinct elements sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()  # Use a set to store seen elements
    for num in lst:
        complement = -num  # The complement of a number is its negative
        if complement in seen:  # If the complement is in the set
            return True  # We have found two numbers that sum to zero
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set
    return False  # If we have iterated over the entire list and not found a pair

# Example Usage
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This function uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far. For each number in the list, it checks if its complement (i.e., its negative) is in the set. If it is, the function immediately returns True, indicating that it has found two numbers that sum to zero. If it iterates over the entire list without finding a pair, it returns False. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), making it efficient for large lists.
