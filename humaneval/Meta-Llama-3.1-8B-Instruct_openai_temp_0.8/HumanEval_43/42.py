### pairs_sum_to_zero Function

This function checks if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    # Create a set to store the elements we have seen so far
    seen = set()
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for num in l:
        # Check if the negation of the current number is in the seen set
        if -num in seen:
            # If it is, return True because we found two numbers that sum to zero
            return True
        else:
            # If not, add the current number to the seen set
            seen.add(num)
    
    # If we have iterated over the entire list and haven't found two numbers that sum to zero, return False
    return False

# Test cases
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we are doing a single pass through the list. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the seen set.
