### Pairs Sum to Zero
#### Python Script

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()  # Create an empty set to store the elements we've seen so far
    for num in lst:  # Iterate over each number in the list
        complement = -num  # Calculate the complement of the current number (i.e., the number that would sum to zero)
        if complement in seen:  # Check if the complement is in the set of seen numbers
            return True  # If the complement is in the set, we've found a pair that sums to zero
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set of seen numbers

    return False  # If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found a pair that sums to zero, return False


# Example usage:
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script uses a set (`seen`) to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. For each number in the input list, we calculate its complement (i.e., the number that would sum to zero). If the complement is in the set of seen numbers, we return True, indicating that we've found a pair that sums to zero. Otherwise, we add the current number to the set of seen numbers and continue iterating over the list. If we reach the end of the list without finding a pair that sums to zero, we return False.
