    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if two distinct elements in the list sum to zero, False otherwise.

This script uses a set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far. For each number, it calculates its complement (i.e., the number that would sum to zero with it) and checks if it's in the set. If it is, we've found a pair that sums to zero, so we return True. If we've iterated over the entire list without finding a pair, we return False.
