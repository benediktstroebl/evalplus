### Python Script: Pairs Sum to Zero

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(nums):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether two distinct elements sum to zero.
    """
    seen = set()  # A set to store the elements we've seen so far
    for num in nums:
        complement = -num  # The number we need to sum to zero
        if complement in seen:  # If we've seen the complement before
            return True  # Return True, because we've found a pair that sums to zero
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set
    return False  # If we've iterated over the list and haven't found a pair, return False


# Example usage:
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers and returns a boolean indicating whether two distinct elements sum to zero. It uses a set to keep track of the elements it's seen so far, and checks if the complement of each element (i.e., the number that would sum to zero with it) is in the set. If it finds a pair that sums to zero, it returns True immediately. If it iterates over the entire list without finding a pair, it returns False.
