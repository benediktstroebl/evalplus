### pairs_sum_to_zero Function
#### Finds if two distinct elements in a list sum to zero

Below is a Python function that uses a set data structure to efficiently check for pairs of elements that sum to zero.

### Python Code
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()  # A set to store the elements we have seen so far
    for num in l:
        complement = -num  # The number that would sum to zero with num
        if complement in seen:  # If we have seen the complement before
            return True  # Then there are two distinct elements that sum to zero
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set of seen numbers
    return False  # If we have iterated over the entire list and not found a pair, return False


# Example use cases:
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```
This function runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the list, because each element is added to the set once and looked up once. It uses O(n) space to store the elements in the set.
