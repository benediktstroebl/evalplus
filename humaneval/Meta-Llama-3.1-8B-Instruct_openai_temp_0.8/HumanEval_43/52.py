    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.

This script uses a set called `seen` to store the elements we've seen so far. For each number in the input list, it checks if the complement (i.e. the number that would sum to zero with the current number) is in the `seen` set. If it is, it returns True, because we've found two distinct elements that sum to zero. If it iterates over the entire list and doesn't find a pair, it returns False.
