Here's a Python function that implements the specified behavior:

```markdown
## pairs_sum_to_zero Function

This function checks if there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.

### Code

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    Checks if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create a set to store the elements we've seen so far
    seen = set()
    
    # Iterate over the list
    for num in l:
        # If the negative of the current element is in the set, return True
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        # Otherwise, add the current element to the set
        seen.add(num)
    
    # If we've iterated over the entire list and haven't found a pair that sums to zero, return False
    return False
```

### Example Use Cases

```python
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This function works by iterating over the list and checking if the negative of each element is in the set. If it is, that means we've found a pair that sums to zero, and we return True. If we've iterated over the entire list without finding such a pair, we return False. The set is used to keep track of the elements we've seen so far, allowing us to check for pairs in O(n) time.
