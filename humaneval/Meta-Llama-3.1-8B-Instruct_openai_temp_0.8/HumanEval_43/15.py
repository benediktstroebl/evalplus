This script works by iterating through the list. For each number, it checks if the negative of that number is in the set `seen`. If it is, it means we've found two numbers that sum to zero, so it immediately returns `True`. If it hasn't found such a pair after going through the entire list, it returns `False`. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), making it efficient for large lists.
