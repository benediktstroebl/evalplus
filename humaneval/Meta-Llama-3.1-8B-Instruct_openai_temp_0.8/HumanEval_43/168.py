Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False

# Test cases
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far. For each number in the input list, it checks if its negative is in the set. If it is, it means that the number and its negative sum to zero, so the function returns True. If it doesn't find any such pair after checking all numbers, it returns False.
