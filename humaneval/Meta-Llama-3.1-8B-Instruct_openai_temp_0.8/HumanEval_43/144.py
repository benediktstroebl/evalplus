This script creates a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if two distinct elements sum to zero, and False otherwise. It uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far, making it efficient to check for the complement of each number. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
