### Pairs Sum to Zero Function
#### Description
This script provides a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that checks if there are two distinct elements in a list of integers that sum to zero.

#### Code
```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(lst):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.
    """
    # Create a set to store the elements we have seen so far
    seen = set()
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the negative of the current number is in the set
        if -num in seen:
            # If it is, return True
            return True
        # Otherwise, add the current number to the set
        seen.add(num)
    
    # If we have iterated over the entire list and not found a pair that sums to zero, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```
This function uses a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far, and checks for pairs that sum to zero by seeing if the negative of the current number is in the set. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, making it efficient for large inputs.
