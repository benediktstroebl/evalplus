### Pairs Summing to Zero
#### A Python Script to Check if Two Distinct Elements in a List Sum to Zero

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(numbers):
    """
    Checks if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are two distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()  # A set to store the numbers we've seen so far
    for num in numbers:
        complement = -num  # The number that would sum to zero with num
        if complement in seen:  # If we've seen the complement before
            return True  # We've found two numbers that sum to zero
        seen.add(num)  # Add the current number to the set
    return False  # If we've iterated over the entire list and found no pairs

# Example use cases
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This script defines a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are two distinct elements that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise. It uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far, allowing it to check for pairs in linear time. The example use cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
