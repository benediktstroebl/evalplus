This script defines a function `same_chars` that takes two strings as input and returns `True` if they have the same characters, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in each word, and then compares the two dictionaries. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
