### Same Characters Counter

This Python script counts the occurrences of each character in two given strings and then compares the counts.

#### Code

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.

    Args:
        s0 (str): The first string.
        s1 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the strings have the same characters, False otherwise.
    """
    # Create dictionaries to store character counts
    count0 = {}
    count1 = {}

    # Count characters in the first string
    for char in s0:
        if char in count0:
            count0[char] += 1
        else:
            count0[char] = 1

    # Count characters in the second string
    for char in s1:
        if char in count1:
            count1[char] += 1
        else:
            count1[char] = 1

    # Compare character counts
    return count0 == count1


# Example usage
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd'))  # True
print(same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # False
print(same chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce'))  # False
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc'))  # False
```

#### Explanation

This script uses two dictionaries (`count0` and `count1`) to store the counts of each character in the two input strings. It then compares these dictionaries to determine if the strings have the same characters. This approach has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings, respectively.
