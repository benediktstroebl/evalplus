### Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.

    Args:
    s0 (str): The first word.
    s1 (str): The second word.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the words have the same characters, False otherwise.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each character in both words
    count0 = Counter(s0)
    count1 = Counter(s1)

    # Check if the frequency counts are equal
    return count0 == count1

# Test cases
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd'))  # True
print(same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # False
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce'))  # False
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc'))  # False
```

### Explanation

This solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in both words. It then checks if the frequency counts are equal by comparing the two `Counter` objects. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of characters in both words.
