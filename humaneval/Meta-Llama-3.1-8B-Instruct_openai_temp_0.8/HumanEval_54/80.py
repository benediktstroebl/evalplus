This script defines the `same_chars` function, which takes two strings as input and returns `True` if they have the same characters, and `False` otherwise. It uses the fact that sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, which makes comparing the two strings easy.

The `test_same_chars` function is a helper function that runs the test cases for you. It prints the input and output for each test case to help verify that the `same_chars` function is working correctly.
