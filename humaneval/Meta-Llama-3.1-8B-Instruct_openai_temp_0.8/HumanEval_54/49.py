This script uses two dictionaries, `freq_s0` and `freq_s1`, to store the character frequencies in each word. It counts the frequency of each character in the first word and the second word separately, and then checks if the two dictionaries are equal. If the dictionaries are equal, it means the two words have the same characters, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
