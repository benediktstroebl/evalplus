```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    
    This function takes two strings as input and returns True if they have the same characters, 
    regardless of their order or repetition. It returns False otherwise.
    
    Parameters:
    s0 (str): The first string
    s1 (str): The second string
    
    Returns:
    bool: Whether the two strings have the same characters
    """
    # Remove duplicates from the first string by converting it to a set
    set0 = set(s0)
    
    # Remove duplicates from the second string by converting it to a set
    set1 = set(s1)
    
    # Compare the two sets, which will be equal if the original strings have the same characters
    return set0 == set1

# Test cases
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd'))  # True
print(same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # False
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce'))  # False
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc'))  # False
```

This script works by first removing duplicate characters from each string by converting them to sets. Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, so any duplicates are automatically removed. The function then simply compares the two sets to determine whether the original strings have the same characters.
