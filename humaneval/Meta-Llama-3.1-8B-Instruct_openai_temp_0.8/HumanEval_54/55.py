This script defines the function `same_chars` that takes two strings `s0` and `s1` as input and returns `True` if they have the same characters, and `False` otherwise. It does this by converting the strings to sorted lists of characters, which removes the need to check the order of characters, and then comparing these lists. The function is then tested with the provided test cases.
