This script defines a function `same_chars` that takes two strings as input and returns `True` if the strings have the same characters, and `False` otherwise. The function uses two dictionaries to store the frequency of each character in both strings, and then compares these dictionaries to determine if the strings are equal. The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior with various inputs.
