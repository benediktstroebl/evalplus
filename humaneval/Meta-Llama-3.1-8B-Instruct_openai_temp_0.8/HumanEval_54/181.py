This script works by converting each word to a set, which removes duplicates and ignores order. It then compares the two sets using the `==` operator, which works because sets are equal if and only if their elements are equal. The `sorted` function is used to ensure that the sets are in the same order before comparison, because sets are unordered and `==` would not work as expected on unordered sets.
