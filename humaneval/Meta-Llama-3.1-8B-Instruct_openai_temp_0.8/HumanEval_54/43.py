    Returns:
        bool: True if the words have the same characters, False otherwise.

This script defines a function `same_chars` that checks if two words have the same characters. It does this by converting the words to sets of characters and comparing the two sets. The set data structure in Python has a constant time complexity for lookups, making this approach efficient even for large words. The example use cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
