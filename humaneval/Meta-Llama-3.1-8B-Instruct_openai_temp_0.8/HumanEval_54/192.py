In this script, we use the `collections.Counter` class to count the occurrences of each character in the input strings. This results in two dictionaries, one for each string, where the keys are the characters and the values are the counts. We then compare these two dictionaries using the `==` operator, which compares dictionaries by comparing their keys and values. If the two dictionaries are equal, it means the input strings have the same characters, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
