### Same Characters in Two Strings
#### Problem Description
Check if two words have the same characters, regardless of order or repetition.

#### Solution
```python
from collections import Counter

def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.

    Args:
    s0 (str): The first word.
    s1 (str): The second word.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the words have the same characters, False otherwise.
    """
    # Remove spaces and convert to lowercase
    s0 = s0.replace(" ", "").lower()
    s1 = s1.replace(" ", "").lower()

    # Count the frequency of each character in both strings
    counter0 = Counter(s0)
    counter1 = Counter(s1)

    # Compare the two counters
    return counter0 == counter1


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))  # True
    print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # True
    print(same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd'))  # True
    print(same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # False
    print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce'))  # False
    print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc'))  # False
```
This script uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in both strings. It then compares the two counters to determine if the strings have the same characters. The `replace(" ", "")` method is used to remove spaces, and the `lower()` method is used to convert the strings to lowercase, so that the comparison is case-insensitive.
