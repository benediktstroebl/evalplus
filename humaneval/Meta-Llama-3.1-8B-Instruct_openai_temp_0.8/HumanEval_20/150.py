### Closest Pair Finder
#### Problem: Return the two closest numbers from a list of floats.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers (at least two).

    Returns:
    Tuple[float, float]: A tuple of two numbers that are the closest to each other.

    Example:
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """

    # First sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the pair of closest numbers
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])

    # Iterate over the sorted list to find the pair with the minimum difference
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the next one
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        
        # If the difference is smaller than the current minimum difference, update the minimum difference and the closest pair
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))
