### Python Script to Find Closest Elements in a List
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers: A list of float numbers.

    Returns:
        A tuple of two float numbers that are the closest to each other.

    Examples:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list to find the closest pair of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the absolute difference between the current pair of numbers
        diff = abs(numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i])
        
        # Update the minimum difference and the closest pair if a smaller difference is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```
This script sorts the list of numbers in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted list to find the closest pair of numbers. It keeps track of the minimum difference found and the corresponding pair of numbers. The function returns the closest pair of numbers in the sorted order.
