```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of float numbers of length at least two.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple containing two numbers from the list that are the closest to each other.

    Examples:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)

    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the pair of closest numbers
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])

print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))

```

This script first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Then it iterates over the sorted list to find the pair of numbers with the minimum difference, which is the pair of closest numbers. The function returns this pair of numbers. If the list contains duplicate numbers, the function will return the duplicate numbers as the pair of closest numbers.
