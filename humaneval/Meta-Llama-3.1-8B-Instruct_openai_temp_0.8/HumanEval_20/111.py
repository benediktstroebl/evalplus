### Find Closest Elements in a List
#### Problem Description
Find two numbers in a list that are closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
    Tuple[float, float]: A tuple containing the two closest numbers in order.

    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the pair of numbers with the minimum difference
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])

    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the absolute difference between the current number and the next number
        diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1])

        # If the current difference is smaller than the minimum difference found so far, update the minimum difference and the closest pair
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

    # Return the closest pair of numbers
    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))
```
This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers in order. The function iterates over the list of numbers and calculates the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive numbers. The pair with the smallest difference is stored and returned at the end of the function.
