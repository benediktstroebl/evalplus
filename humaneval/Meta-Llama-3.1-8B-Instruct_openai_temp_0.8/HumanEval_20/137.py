```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of at least two floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple of two numbers that are closest to each other.

    Example:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)

    # First, sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Initialize with positive infinity

    # Iterate over the list of numbers to find the closest pair

# Example usage:
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the pair of numbers that are closest to each other. The function sorts the list of numbers in ascending order and then iterates over the list to find the pair of numbers with the minimum difference. The function returns this pair of numbers.
