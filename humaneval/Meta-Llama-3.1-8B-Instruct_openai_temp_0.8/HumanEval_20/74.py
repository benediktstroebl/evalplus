### Find Closest Elements in a List

This script takes a list of numbers as input and returns two numbers that are the closest to each other.

#### Code
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers of length at least two.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: Two numbers that are the closest to each other.

    Example:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Check if the list has less than two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must have at least two elements.")

    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])

    # Iterate over the list to find the pair of numbers with the minimum difference
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

    return closest_pair
```

#### Example Use Cases
```python
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```

Note: This script assumes that the list of numbers has at least two elements. If the list has less than two elements, it raises a ValueError.
