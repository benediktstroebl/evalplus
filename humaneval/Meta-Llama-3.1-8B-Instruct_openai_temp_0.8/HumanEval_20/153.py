### Find Closest Elements in a List
#### Problem Description
Find two numbers in a list that are closest to each other.

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple containing the two closest numbers in order.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list has less than two elements.
    """
    # Check if the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The list must have at least two elements")

    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Initialize with positive infinity
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])

    # Iterate through the list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

    return closest_pair

# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
    print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))
```

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating point numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the two closest numbers in order. The function first checks if the list has at least two elements, then sorts the list in ascending order. It then iterates through the list to find the closest pair of numbers by keeping track of the minimum difference found so far. Finally, it returns the closest pair of numbers. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
