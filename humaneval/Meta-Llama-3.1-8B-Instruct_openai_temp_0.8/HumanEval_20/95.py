```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other
    and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floats.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple of two floats that are the closest to each other.

    Example:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the pair of numbers with the minimum difference
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Initialize with positive infinity
    closest_pair = ()

    # Iterate over the sorted list to find the pair with the minimum difference
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the next number
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floats as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and then iterates over the sorted list to find the pair of numbers with the minimum difference. The function returns this pair of numbers. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
