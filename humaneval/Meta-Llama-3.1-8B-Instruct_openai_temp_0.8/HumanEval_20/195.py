### Find Closest Elements
#### Problem Statement
From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers: A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        A tuple of two floating point numbers that are the closest to each other.

    Example:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the pair of numbers with the minimum difference
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = ()
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list of numbers to find the pair with the minimum difference
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))   # (2.0, 2.0)
```
This script first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order, then iterates over the list to find the pair of numbers with the minimum difference. The function returns this pair of numbers as a tuple. If the list contains duplicate numbers, the function will return a pair of identical numbers.
