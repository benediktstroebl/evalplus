    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple of two numbers that are the closest to each other.

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two numbers that are the closest to each other. The function first checks if the list has at least two elements, then sorts the list in ascending order. It initializes the minimum difference and the pair of closest numbers, and then iterates over the sorted list to find the pair of closest numbers. If a smaller difference is found, it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair. Finally, it returns the closest pair.

In the test section, the script calls the function with two different lists of numbers and prints the results.
