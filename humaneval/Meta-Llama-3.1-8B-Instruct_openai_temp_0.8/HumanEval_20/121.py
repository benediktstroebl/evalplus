### Find Closest Elements in a List
#### Problem Description
Given a list of numbers, find and return two elements that are the closest to each other.

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple containing the two closest elements.

    Example:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """

    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (None, None)

    # Iterate over the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])

    return closest_pair

# Example usage:
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))
```
This script works by first sorting the list of numbers. It then iterates over the sorted list, tracking the minimum difference between adjacent elements and the corresponding closest pair. Finally, it returns the closest pair.
