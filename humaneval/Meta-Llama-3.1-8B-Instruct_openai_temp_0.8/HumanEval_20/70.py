### Find Closest Elements in a List of Numbers
#### Problem Statement
From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

#### Solution
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Finds and returns the two closest numbers in a list.

    Args:
    numbers (List[float]): A list of at least two numbers.

    Returns:
    Tuple[float, float]: The two closest numbers in the list.

    Examples:
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Initialize with positive infinity
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])  # Initialize with the first number

    # Iterate over the sorted list of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the next number
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]

        # If the difference is smaller than the current minimum difference, update the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

    # Return the closest pair of numbers
    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))
```
This script sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list to find the closest pair of numbers. It keeps track of the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers, and returns the closest pair of numbers at the end.
