def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers: A list of floating point numbers of length at least two.

    Returns:
        A tuple of two floating point numbers that are the closest to each other.

    Example:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    numbers.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])

    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of floating point numbers as input and returns a tuple of two numbers that are the closest to each other. The function first sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list to find the pair of numbers with the smallest difference. The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function's behavior.
