### Finding the Closest Elements in a List

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two numbers that are closest to each other.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other
    and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple of two numbers that are closest to each other.

    Examples:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """

    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()

    # Initialize variables to store the closest pair and the smallest difference
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])
    min_diff = float('inf')

    # Iterate over the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the next number
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]

        # If the difference is smaller than the current smallest difference, update the closest pair and the smallest difference
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))
```

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and then iterates over the sorted list to find the closest pair of numbers. The closest pair is the pair with the smallest difference, which is calculated as the absolute difference between the two numbers. The function returns a tuple of the two numbers in the closest pair.
