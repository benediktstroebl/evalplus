```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers with at least two elements.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: Two numbers from the list that are the closest to each other.

    Examples:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input, sorts it, and then iterates over the sorted list to find the pair of numbers with the minimum difference. The function returns this pair of numbers. The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
