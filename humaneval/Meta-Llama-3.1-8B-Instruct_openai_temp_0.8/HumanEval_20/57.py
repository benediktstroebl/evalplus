This script first checks if the input list has at least two elements. If not, it raises a ValueError. Then it sorts the list in ascending order. It initializes the minimum difference and the pair of closest numbers to infinity and the first element of the list, respectively. It then iterates over the list to find the pair with the minimum difference. If the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and the pair of closest numbers. Finally, it returns the pair of closest numbers.
