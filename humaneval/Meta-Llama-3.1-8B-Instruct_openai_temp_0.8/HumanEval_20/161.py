### Find Two Closest Elements in a List
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: A tuple containing the two closest numbers in the list.

    Examples:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
        (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[0])
    
    # Iterate over the list to find the closest pair of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the next number
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        
        # If the difference is less than the minimum difference, update the minimum difference and the closest pair
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

# Test the function
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))
```
This script first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. It then iterates over the list to find the closest pair of numbers by keeping track of the minimum difference found so far and updating it as it iterates over the list. The closest pair of numbers is returned as a tuple.
