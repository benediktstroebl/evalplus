```python

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

    Args:
        numbers: A list of at least two float numbers.

    Returns:
        A tuple of two float numbers that are the closest to each other.

    Examples:
        >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
        (2.0, 2.2)

This script defines a function `find_closest_elements` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two numbers that are the closest to each other. The function sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over the sorted list to find the pair with the minimum difference. The function returns the closest pair as a tuple. The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's usage.
