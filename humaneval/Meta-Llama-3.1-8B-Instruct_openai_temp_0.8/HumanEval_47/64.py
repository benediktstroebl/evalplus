### Median Calculation in Python

Here's a Python function that calculates the median of a list of numbers:

```markdown
### code
```python
def median(lst: list):
    """
    Return the median of elements in the list lst.
    
    The calculation method used is based on the length of the input list:
    - If the list has an odd length, the median is the middle number.
    - If the list has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:
        float: The median of the input list.
    """
    # First, we sort the list in ascending order
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    
    # Get the length of the list
    n = len(sorted_lst)
    
    # If the list has an odd length, return the middle number
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return sorted_lst[n // 2]
    
    # If the list has an even length, return the average of the two middle numbers
    else:
        mid1 = sorted_lst[n // 2 - 1]
        mid2 = sorted_lst[n // 2]
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2

# Example usage:
print(median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3
print(median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]))  # Output: 15.0
```

### Usage and Notes

*   This function uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the input list in ascending order.
*   It handles both odd and even lengths of the input list by checking the remainder of the length divided by 2.
*   If the length is odd, it returns the middle number. If the length is even, it returns the average of the two middle numbers.
*   The function uses Markdown formatting for maximum readability.
