This script defines a function `median` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median of those numbers. It uses Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the list, then checks whether the list has an odd or even number of elements. If it's odd, the median is the middle element; if it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The example usage at the end shows how to use this function with two example lists.
