Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem in a markdown code block:
```python
def median(lst: list):
    """
    Return median of elements in the list lst.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the elements in the list.

    Examples:
        >>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
        3
        >>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])
        15.0
    """
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    
    # Get the length of the list
    n = len(sorted_lst)
    
    # If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element
    if n % 2!= 0:
        return sorted_lst[n // 2]
    
    # If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements
    else:
        mid1 = sorted_lst[n // 2 - 1]
        mid2 = sorted_lst[n // 2]
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2


# Test the function
print(median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3
print(median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]))  # Output: 15.0
```

This script uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the list in ascending order, and then calculates the median based on whether the list has an odd or even number of elements. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the list.
