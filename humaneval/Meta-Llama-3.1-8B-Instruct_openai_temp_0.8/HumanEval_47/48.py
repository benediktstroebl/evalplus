### Median Calculation Script

#### Description
This script calculates the median of a list of numbers.

#### Code

```python
def median(numbers: list):
    """
    Return median of elements in the list numbers.

    The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers.
    If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average
    of the two middle values.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the list of numbers.

    Examples:
        >>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
        3
        >>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])
        15.0
    """
    numbers.sort()
    n = len(numbers)

    # If the list has an odd number of elements, return the middle value
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return numbers[n // 2]
    # If the list has an even number of elements, return the average of
    # the two middle values
    else:
        return (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
print(median(numbers))  # Output: 3

numbers = [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]
print(median(numbers))  # Output: 15.0
```

#### Explanation

This script defines a function `median` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median of those numbers. The function first sorts the list using the built-in `sort` method. It then checks if the list has an odd or even number of elements. If the list has an odd number of elements, it returns the middle value. If the list has an even number of elements, it returns the average of the two middle values.

The script includes example usage at the end to demonstrate how to use the `median` function.
