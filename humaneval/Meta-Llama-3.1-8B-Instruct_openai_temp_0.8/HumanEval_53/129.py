### Running the Script
To run this script, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `add_numbers.py`), then use the Python interpreter to execute it:
```bash
$ python add_numbers.py
```
However, since this script doesn't take any command-line arguments, it doesn't need to be run from the command line. The documentation is included directly in the script.
