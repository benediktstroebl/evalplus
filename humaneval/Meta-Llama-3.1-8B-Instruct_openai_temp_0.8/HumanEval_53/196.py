```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
    x (int): The first number
    y (int): The second number

    Returns:
    int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12

    return x + y

# Test the function
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

This script defines the `add` function, which takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. It then tests the function with two example use cases and prints the results. The function documentation includes a description, argument and return type information, and several examples of usage.
