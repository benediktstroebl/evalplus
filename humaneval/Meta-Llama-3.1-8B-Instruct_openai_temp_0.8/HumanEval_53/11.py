    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12

    return x + y

# Example usage:
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

This script defines a function `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. It includes docstrings to provide documentation and examples of usage. The function is then tested with two example inputs to demonstrate its behavior.
