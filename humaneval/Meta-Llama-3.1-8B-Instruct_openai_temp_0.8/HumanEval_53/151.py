### Add Two Numbers Function
#### Problem: Implement a function to add two numbers.
#### Solution: Here's a simple Python function to add two numbers.

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """
    Add two numbers x and y.

    Args:
    x (int): The first number.
    y (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of x and y.

    Examples:
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

This function uses the built-in addition operator in Python (`+`) to add the two numbers. It also includes a docstring that describes the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value, along with some examples of how to use it.
