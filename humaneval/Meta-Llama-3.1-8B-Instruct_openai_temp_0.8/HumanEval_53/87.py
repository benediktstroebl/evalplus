print(add(5, 7))  # Expected output: 12
```

This script defines a function `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. The function includes a docstring that explains what the function does, lists its parameters and return value, and provides example usage of the function. The script then tests the function with two example inputs.
