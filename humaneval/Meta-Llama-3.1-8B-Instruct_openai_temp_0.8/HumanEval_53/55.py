This script defines a function called `add` which takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns their sum. It includes a docstring that describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value, as well as provides examples of how to use it. The `-> int` syntax in the function definition indicates that the function returns an integer.

You can save this script to a file (e.g., `add.py`) and run it from the command line using Python (e.g., `python add.py`).
