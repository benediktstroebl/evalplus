        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y
    
    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12

print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

This script defines a function `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. It also includes docstrings for documentation and Doctests for testing. The function is tested at the end by calling it with different inputs and printing the results.
