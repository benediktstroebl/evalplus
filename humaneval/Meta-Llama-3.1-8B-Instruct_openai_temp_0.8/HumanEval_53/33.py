```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12
    """
    return x + y

# Test the function
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

In this script, the `add` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. The example use cases are provided using the `>>>` syntax, which is a common way to represent interactive shell sessions in documentation. The function is then tested with two example calls to demonstrate its correctness.
