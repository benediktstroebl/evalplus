### Addition Function
```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12
    """
    return x + y
```

### Running the Script
You can save this script to a file (e.g., `addition.py`) and run it from the command line with `python addition.py`. However, since there is no explicit execution command in the script, it won't output anything. To see the example usage, you can use an interactive Python environment like `python -i addition.py`. After running the script with `python -i addition.py`, you can use the `add` function directly in the interactive shell.
