```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Example:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12

    return x + y

# Test the function
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

This script defines a function called `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The function includes a docstring that provides documentation on its usage and includes example usage. The script then tests the function with two examples.
