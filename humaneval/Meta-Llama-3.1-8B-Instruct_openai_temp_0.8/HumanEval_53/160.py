```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12
    """
    return x + y

# Test the function
print(add(2, 3))  # Expected output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Expected output: 12
```

This script defines the `add` function as requested, with a docstring that includes a description of the function, its arguments, its return value, and examples of how to use it. The function itself simply returns the sum of its two arguments. The script then tests the function with two example calls.
