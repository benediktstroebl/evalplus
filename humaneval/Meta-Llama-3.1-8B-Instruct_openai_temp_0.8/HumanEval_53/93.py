```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y.

    Args:
    x (int): The first number to add.
    y (int): The second number to add.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of x and y.

    Examples:
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y

# Run the function with example inputs
print(add(2, 3))
print(add(5, 7))
```

In this script, I have refactored the docstring for clarity and added an example use case in the script to demonstrate how to run the function. The function itself remains the same and simply returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
