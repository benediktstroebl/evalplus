```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12

    return x + y

# Test the function
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

This script defines a function called `add` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. The function includes a documentation string that provides a description of the function, its parameters, and its return value. The example use cases are also included in the docstring for clarity. 

The script then prints the results of calling the `add` function with two pairs of input values to demonstrate its usage.
