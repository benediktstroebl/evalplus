**Add Two Numbers Function**
==========================

The following Python script defines a function `add` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12
    """
    return x + y

# Test the function
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

This script provides a clear and concise definition of the `add` function, along with examples of its usage. The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, and return value. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
