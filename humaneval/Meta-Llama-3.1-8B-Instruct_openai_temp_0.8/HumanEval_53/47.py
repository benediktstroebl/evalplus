```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12
    """
    return x + y
```

You can run this script and use the `add` function to add two numbers together. The function takes two arguments `x` and `y`, both of which are integers, adds them together, and returns their sum.
