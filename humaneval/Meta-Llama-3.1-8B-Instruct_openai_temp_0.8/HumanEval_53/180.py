```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Example:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12
    """
    return x + y


# Testing the add function
print(add(2, 3))  # Expected output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Expected output: 12
```

This script defines the `add` function as specified, and includes docstrings with example use cases. It also includes two test calls at the end to demonstrate the function's behavior.
