    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12

print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12

This script defines a function `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. The docstring for the function explains what it does, its input parameters, and its return value, as well as providing some example use cases. The script then tests the function with two example inputs.
