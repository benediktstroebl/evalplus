```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    Add two numbers x and y

    Args:
        x (int): The first number
        y (int): The second number

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:
        >>> add(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add(5, 7)
        12

    return x + y

# Example usage:
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12

This script defines a function `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, adds them together, and returns the result. The function also includes a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides example usage. The script then demonstrates how to use the `add` function by calling it with a few different pairs of numbers.
