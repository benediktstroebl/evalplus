    Returns:
    int: The sum of x and y

    Examples:

This script defines a function `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. It includes a docstring that provides documentation for the function, including a description, the parameters it takes, and the return value. The docstring also includes examples of how to use the function. The script then demonstrates how to use the `add` function by calling it with two sets of arguments and printing the results.
