```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + sum_to_n(n-1)

# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))
print(sum_to_n(100))
print(sum_to_n(5))
print(sum_to_n(10))
print(sum_to_n(1))
```

However, the above recursive solution has a high time complexity due to repeated calculations. Here is a more efficient solution that uses a mathematical formula to calculate the sum directly:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))
print(sum_to_n(100))
print(sum_to_n(5))
print(sum_to_n(10))
print(sum_to_n(1))
```

This version has a time complexity of O(1) and is much more efficient for large inputs.
