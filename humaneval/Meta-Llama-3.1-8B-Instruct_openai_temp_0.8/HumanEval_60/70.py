    sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1

    # Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n * (n + 1) / 2
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Test the function

This script defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The function then tests itself with the provided examples. The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure the result is an integer.
