### Sum of Numbers from 1 to n

Here's a Python function that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using a simple formula.

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit for the sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    # Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n * (n + 1) / 2
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

This function uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum directly, rather than iterating over the numbers. This makes it more efficient for large values of n.
