This script defines a function `sum_to_n` that uses the built-in `sum` function in combination with the `range` function to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. The function includes a docstring that explains its purpose and provides examples of how to use it. The script also includes test cases to verify that the function works correctly.
