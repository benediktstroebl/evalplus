    return sum(range(1, n + 1))

# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050

However, this solution uses the built-in Python function `sum()`, which is fine for small inputs. For large inputs, this solution can still be inefficient because it creates a list of all the numbers and then sums the list. A more efficient solution is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """
    sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

This solution is more efficient because it avoids creating a list and directly calculates the sum. It has a time complexity of O(1), meaning its running time is constant regardless of the size of the input.
