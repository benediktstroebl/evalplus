    sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.

    Example:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    # Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n * (n + 1) / 2
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Expected output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Expected output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Expected output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Expected output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Expected output: 1

This Python script defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The function is then tested with the provided example inputs. The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure the result is an integer.
