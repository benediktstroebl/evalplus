    sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))


# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1

This script defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the built-in `sum` function and `range` function. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (exclusive), and the `sum` function adds up these numbers. The function returns the result.

The script also includes doctests to verify that the function works correctly for different inputs. The doctests are comments that start with `>>>` and contain the expected output of the function for a given input.
