This script defines a function `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. The function uses the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, to calculate the sum efficiently. The script also includes docstrings and example use cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
