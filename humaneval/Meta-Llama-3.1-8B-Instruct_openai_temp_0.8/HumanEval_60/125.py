```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))

# Example usage:
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

However, an even more efficient way to solve this problem is by using a mathematical formula rather than the sum function. The sum of numbers from 1 to n is given by the formula n*(n+1)//2. Here is an implementation of this formula:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Example usage:
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

The math formula solution is generally faster and more memory efficient than the sum function solution because it avoids the overhead of creating a range object and iterating over it.
