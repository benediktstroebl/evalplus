**Summation of Numbers from 1 to n**
=====================================

Here is a Python function that uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """
    sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit for the sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of numbers from 1 to n.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_to_n(30)
        465
        >>> sum_to_n(100)
        5050
        >>> sum_to_n(5)
        15
        >>> sum_to_n(10)
        55
        >>> sum_to_n(1)
        1
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Test the function
print(sum_to_n(30))   # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))    # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))   # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))    # Output: 1
```

This function uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms in the series. The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure that the result is an integer.
