```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers

    Returns:
        List[float]: A list of floating point numbers, rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1]

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list has less than two elements

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """

    # Check if the input list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")

    # Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)

    # Apply the linear transform
    rescaled_numbers = [(x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for x in numbers]

    return rescaled_numbers

# Test the function
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

```

This Python script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of floating point numbers as input and returns a new list with the same numbers but rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1]. The function first checks if the input list has at least two elements, then finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and finally applies a linear transform to each number in the list. The result is returned as a new list.
