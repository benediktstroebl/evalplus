def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of at least two floating point numbers

    Returns:
        List[float]: A list of floats where the smallest is 0 and the largest is 1

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list has less than two elements

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

    # Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)

    # Apply the linear transform
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
print(rescale_to_unit(numbers))  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of floating point numbers and returns a new list with the same numbers, but scaled to the range [0, 1]. It first checks if the input list has at least two elements, and raises a `ValueError` if not. It then finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and applies a linear transform to each number in the list, scaling it to the range [0, 1].
