### Rescale a List of Numbers to Unit Range
#### Python Implementation

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1

    Args:
        numbers: A list of float numbers

    Returns:
        A list of float numbers rescaled to the unit range [0, 1]

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list has less than two elements

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """

    # Check if the input list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")

    # Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)

    # Check if all numbers in the list are equal
    if min_val == max_val:
        # If all numbers are equal, return a list of zeros
        return [0.0] * len(numbers)

    # Apply the linear transform to rescale the numbers to the unit range
    return [(num - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for num in numbers]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescaled_numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(rescaled_numbers)
```

This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the same numbers rescaled to the unit range [0, 1]. The rescaling is done using a linear transform that maps the smallest number to 0 and the largest number to 1. If the input list has less than two elements, the function raises a `ValueError`. If all numbers in the list are equal, the function returns a list of zeros.
