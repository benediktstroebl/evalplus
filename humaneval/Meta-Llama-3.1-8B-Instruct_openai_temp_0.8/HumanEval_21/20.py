```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floats

    Returns:
        List[float]: The transformed list

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")

    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)

    if max_val == min_val:
        return [0.0] * len(numbers)

    return [(n - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for n in numbers]

# Test the function
print(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))
```

This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of floats, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and applies a linear transformation to the list such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. If the input list has only one element, or all elements are the same, it raises a ValueError. The script also includes a test case to demonstrate the function's behavior.
