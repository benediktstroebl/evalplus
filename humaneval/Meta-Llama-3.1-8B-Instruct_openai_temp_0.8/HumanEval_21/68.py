def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers

    Returns:
        List[float]: The rescaled list of numbers

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

```

This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where the smallest number is 0 and the largest number is 1. The script also includes example usage and error handling to ensure the input list contains at least two unique elements.
