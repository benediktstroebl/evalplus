### Rescaling a List of Numbers to the Unit Interval
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of at least two float numbers.

    Returns:
        List[float]: A new list with the numbers in the unit interval [0, 1].

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    # Check if the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The list must have at least two elements")

    # Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list
    min_num = min(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)

    # Check if the minimum and maximum numbers are the same
    if min_num == max_num:
        # If they are the same, return a list of zeros
        return [0.0] * len(numbers)

    # Apply the linear transform to the list
    rescaled_numbers = [(num - min_num) / (max_num - min_num) for num in numbers]

    return rescaled_numbers
```
You can use this function like this:
```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescaled_numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(rescaled_numbers)  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
