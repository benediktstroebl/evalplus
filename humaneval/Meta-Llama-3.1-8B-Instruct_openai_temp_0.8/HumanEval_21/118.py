### Rescaling a List of Numbers to Unit Range
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of at least two float numbers.

    Returns:
        List[float]: The rescaled list of numbers.

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    # Check if the input list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("The input list must have at least two elements.")

    # Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)

    # Check for zero range to avoid division by zero
    if max_val == min_val:
        raise ValueError("All numbers in the list must be distinct.")

    # Apply the linear transform to the list
    rescaled_numbers = [(n - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for n in numbers]

    return rescaled_numbers

# Example usage:
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
print(rescale_to_unit(numbers))  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
This script defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers, finds the minimum and maximum values, and applies a linear transform to rescale the numbers to the unit range [0, 1]. It includes error checking to ensure the input list has at least two distinct elements and handles the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same.
