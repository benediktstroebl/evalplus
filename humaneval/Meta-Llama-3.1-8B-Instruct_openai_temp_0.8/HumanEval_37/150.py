```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that 
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal 
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even indices sorted.

    Examples:
        >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
        [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    # Separate the list into even and odd indices
    even = l[::2]
    odd = l[1::2]

    # Sort the even indices
    even.sort()

    # Combine the sorted even indices with the original odd indices
    return [x for pair in zip(even, odd) for x in pair]
```

This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list as input, separates it into even and odd indices, sorts the even indices, and then combines them with the original odd indices to produce the final output. The function uses list slicing (`l[::2]` and `l[1::2]`) to separate the list into even and odd indices, and the `zip` function to combine them. The list comprehension is used to flatten the list of pairs into a single list.
