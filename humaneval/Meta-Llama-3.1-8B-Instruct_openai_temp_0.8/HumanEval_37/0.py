This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` as input, separates the list into two lists (one for even indicies and one for odd indicies), sorts the list for even indicies, and then combines the two lists, preserving the original order of elements at odd indicies. The function returns the modified list. The script also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
