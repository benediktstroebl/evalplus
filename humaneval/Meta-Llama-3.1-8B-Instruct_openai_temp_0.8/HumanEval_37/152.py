This script accomplishes the task by using list comprehensions to separate the even and odd indexed elements of the input list, sorting the even indexed elements, and then combining them back together to form the final list. It uses the `enumerate` function to keep track of the index of each element, which is necessary to determine whether an element is at an even or odd index.
