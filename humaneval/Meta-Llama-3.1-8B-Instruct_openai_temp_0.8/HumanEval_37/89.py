### Even Index Sort Function
#### Purpose
This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` and returns a new list where the values at even indices are sorted, while the values at odd indices remain unchanged.

#### Code
```python
def sort_even(l: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even indices sorted.
    """
    # Separate even and odd indices
    even_indices = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    odd_indices = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2!= 0]

    # Sort the values at even indices
    even_indices.sort()

    # Combine the two lists
    result = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(even_indices[i // 2])
        else:
            result.append(odd_indices[i // 2])

    return result

# Example use cases
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

#### Explanation
This script first separates the input list `l` into two lists: `even_indices` and `odd_indices`. It then sorts `even_indices` in ascending order. Finally, it combines the two lists, placing the sorted even indices at their corresponding positions and keeping the odd indices unchanged. The resulting list is returned as the output of the `sort_even` function.
