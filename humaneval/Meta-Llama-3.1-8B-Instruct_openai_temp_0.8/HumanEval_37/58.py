```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indices, while its values at the even indices are equal
    to the values of the even indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): Input list

    Returns:
        list: Processed list
    """
    # Separate even and odd indexed elements
    even = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    odd = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2!= 0]

    # Sort the even indexed elements
    even.sort()

    # Combine the sorted even and original odd elements
    result = [item for pair in zip(even, odd) for item in pair] + even[len(even):len(even)+len(odd)]

    return result


# Test the function
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))
```

This script first separates the even and odd indexed elements from the input list. It then sorts the even indexed elements and combines them with the original odd indexed elements, filling any remaining even indices with the sorted elements. The combined list is then returned as the result.
