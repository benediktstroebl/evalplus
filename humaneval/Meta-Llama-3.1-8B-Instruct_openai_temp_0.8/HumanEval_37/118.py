```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

    Examples:
        >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
        [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    # Separate the even and odd indices
    even = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    odd = [l[i] for i in range(1, len(l), 2)]

    # Sort the even indices
    even.sort()

    # Combine the sorted even indices with the odd indices
    return [x for pair in zip(even, odd) for x in pair] + even[len(even):]

# Test the function

This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list. It separates the even indices of the input list into one list and the odd indices into another. It sorts the even indices list. Finally, it combines the odd indices with the sorted even indices. If there are more even indices than odd indices, the remaining even indices are appended at the end of the result. The test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function.
