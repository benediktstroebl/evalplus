    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The list with even indices sorted.

This script implements the function `sort_even` that takes a list as input and returns a new list. In the returned list, the elements at even indices are sorted, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged. The script includes docstrings to explain the purpose of the function and its behavior. The function is then tested with the provided examples.
