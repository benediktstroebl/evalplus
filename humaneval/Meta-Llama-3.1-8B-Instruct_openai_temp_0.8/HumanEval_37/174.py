    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

This script defines the `sort_even` function, which takes a list `l` as input, separates its even and odd indices into two lists, sorts the even list, and then combines the sorted even list and the odd list while maintaining the original odd indices. It also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
