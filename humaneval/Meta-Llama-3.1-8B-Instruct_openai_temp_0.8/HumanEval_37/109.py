This script defines the `sort_even` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the elements at even indices are sorted. It uses list comprehension to separate the odd and even elements, sorts the even elements, and then combines them back into a single list. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function with two test cases.
