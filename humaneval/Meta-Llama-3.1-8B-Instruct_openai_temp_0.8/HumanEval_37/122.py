```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even indices sorted.

    Examples:
        >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
        [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    # Separate the list into two lists: one for odd indices and one for even indices
    odd_indices = l[::2]
    even_indices = l[1::2]

    # Sort the list of values at even indices
    even_indices.sort()

    # Combine the two lists back together, with the sorted even indices in the correct positions
    result = [even_indices[i//2] if i % 2 == 0 else odd_indices[i//2] for i in range(len(l))]

    return result

# Example usage:
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))
```

This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list as input, separates it into two lists (one for odd indices and one for even indices), sorts the list of even indices, and then combines the two lists back together to produce the sorted list with even indices in the correct positions.
