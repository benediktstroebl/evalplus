### Sort Even Function

This Python script solves the problem by modifying the input list to have sorted values at even indices.

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list with sorted even indices.
    """
    # Separate the even and odd indices into different lists
    even_indices = [x for x in l if not (i := len(l)) % 2]
    odd_indices = [x for x in l if (i := len(l)) % 2]
    
    # Sort the even indices list
    even_indices.sort()
    
    # Combine the odd indices list and the sorted even indices list
    result = []
    for i, (odd, even) in enumerate(zip(odd_indices, even_indices)):
        result.append(odd)
        result.append(even)
    
    return result

# Test the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))
    print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))
```

This script defines the `sort_even` function that takes a list `l` as input and returns the modified list with sorted values at even indices. It uses list comprehensions to separate the even and odd indices into different lists, sorts the even indices, and then combines the odd indices list and the sorted even indices list using the `zip` function. The function is tested with the provided example inputs.
