    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even indices sorted.
