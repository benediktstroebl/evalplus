This script defines the `sort_even` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list with the even elements sorted. The function first separates the even and odd elements into two lists using list slicing. It then sorts the even elements using the `sort` method. Finally, it combines the sorted even elements with the odd elements using a list comprehension and returns the result. The script includes docstrings and test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
