```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): Input list.

    Returns:
    list: The modified list with even indicies sorted.
    """
    # Separate the even and odd indexed elements
    even = l[::2]
    odd = l[1::2]

    # Sort the even indexed elements
    even.sort()

    # Combine the sorted even elements and the original odd elements
    return [x for pair in zip(even, odd) for x in pair] + even[len(odd):]

# Test cases
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

This script works by first separating the even and odd indexed elements into two separate lists. It then sorts the even indexed elements. Finally, it combines the sorted even elements and the original odd elements, padding with the remaining sorted even elements if necessary.
