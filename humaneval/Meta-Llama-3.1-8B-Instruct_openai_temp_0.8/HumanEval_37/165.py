        else:
            output_list[i] = element

    return output_list


# Test the function
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
```
This code works by first separating the list into two lists: one containing the elements at even indices and the other containing the elements at odd indices. It then sorts the list of elements at even indices. Finally, it combines the two lists, replacing the elements at even indices with the sorted elements.

Alternatively, here is an even more concise version of the function using list comprehension and the `sorted` function with a custom sorting key:

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list according to the problem constraints
    """
    even_elements = sorted([l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0])
    return [el if i % 2!= 0 else even_elements[i // 2] for i, el in enumerate(l)]


# Test the function
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

This version of the function achieves the same result as the previous one, but in a more concise way. It uses list comprehension to create the sorted list of even elements and then uses another list comprehension to combine the odd elements with the sorted even elements.
