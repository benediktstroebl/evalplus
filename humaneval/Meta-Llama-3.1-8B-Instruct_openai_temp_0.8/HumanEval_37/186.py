### Solving the Problem: Sorting Even Indices in a List
Here's a Python script that implements the `sort_even` function as described in the problem:

```markdown
### Code
```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be modified.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even indices sorted.
    """
    # Separate the even and odd elements into two lists
    even = l[::2]
    odd = l[1::2]

    # Sort the even elements
    even.sort()

    # Combine the sorted even elements with the odd elements
    return [x for pair in zip(even, odd) for x in pair] + even[len(odd):]

# Test cases
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

### Explanation
This script works by first separating the input list `l` into two lists: `even` and `odd`. The `even` list contains the elements at even indices, and the `odd` list contains the elements at odd indices.

Next, it sorts the `even` list using the `sort` method.

Finally, it combines the sorted `even` list with the `odd` list using list comprehension. The `zip` function is used to pair the corresponding elements from the `even` and `odd` lists. The remaining elements in the `even` list are appended to the end of the combined list.
