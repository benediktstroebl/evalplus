### Description:
This Python script sorts the elements at even indices in a given list,
while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged.

### Function:
```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The list with even indices sorted.
    """
    # Separate the elements at even and odd indices
    even = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 2!= 0]
    
    # Sort the elements at even indices
    even.sort()
    
    # Combine the sorted even elements with the odd elements
    result = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(even[i // 2])  # Use integer division for even index
        else:
            result.append(odd[i // 2])   # Use integer division for odd index
    
    return result
```

### Example Use Cases:
```python
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # [3, 6, 5, 4]
```
This script uses list comprehension to separate the elements at even and odd indices.
It then sorts the elements at even indices using the built-in `sort` method.
Finally, it combines the sorted even elements with the odd elements to produce the result.
Note that the use of integer division (`i // 2`) is necessary to ensure that the correct elements are assigned to the correct indices in the result list.
