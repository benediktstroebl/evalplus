```python

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even indicies sorted.

This script defines the `sort_even` function that takes a list as input, separates the elements into even and odd indexed elements, sorts the even indexed elements, and combines the sorted even indexed elements with the odd indexed elements. The result is a new list where the even indexed elements are sorted, while the odd indexed elements remain unchanged. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
