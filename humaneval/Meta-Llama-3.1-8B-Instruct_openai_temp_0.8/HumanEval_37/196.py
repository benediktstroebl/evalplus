This script defines a function `sort_even` that takes a list as input, separates the elements at even and odd indices, sorts the even indexed elements, and combines them with the odd indexed elements to produce the sorted list. It includes a docstring that describes the function's behavior, as well as two test cases. The `//` operator is used for integer division to get the index for even indexed values in the sorted list, and the modulus operator `%` is used to check if an index is even.
