def derivative(xs: list):
    """
    This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial represented as a list of coefficients.

    Args:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients where xs[0] is the coefficient of the constant term,
               xs[1] is the coefficient of x, xs[2] is the coefficient of x^2 and so on.

    Returns:
    list: A list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.

    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])

    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
