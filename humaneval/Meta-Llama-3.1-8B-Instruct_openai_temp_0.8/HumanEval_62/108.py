def derivative(xs: list):
    """
    This function calculates the derivative of a given polynomial.
    
    The polynomial is represented as a list of coefficients, where the first element is the constant term,
    and each subsequent element is the coefficient of the corresponding power of x.
    
    The derivative of the polynomial is returned in the same form, with the derivative of the constant term being 0.
    
    Parameters:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients representing the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.
    """
    
    # If the polynomial is a constant term, return [0] because the derivative of a constant is 0

    # For each coefficient in the polynomial, except the last one (the constant term), 
    # multiply it by its power and add it to the list of coefficients of the derivative

This script defines a function `derivative` that takes a list of coefficients representing a polynomial and returns a list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial. The function uses a loop to calculate the coefficients of the derivative, multiplying each coefficient by its power and adding it to the result list. The function also handles the edge case where the input polynomial is a constant term. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the function's correctness.
