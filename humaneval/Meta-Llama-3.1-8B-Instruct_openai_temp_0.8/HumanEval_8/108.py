This script defines a function `sum_product` that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. It initializes the sum and product variables with default values for an empty list, then iterates over the list to calculate the sum and product. Finally, it returns the sum and product as a tuple. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with an empty list and a list of integers.
