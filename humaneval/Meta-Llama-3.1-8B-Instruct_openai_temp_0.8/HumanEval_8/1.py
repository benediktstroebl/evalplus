def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers.

    Returns:
        A tuple of sum and product.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_product([])
        (0, 1)
        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
        (10, 24)

    # Initialize sum and product to 0 and 1 respectively
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the current number with the product
        total_product *= num
    
    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers, calculates the sum and product of all the integers in the list, and returns them as a tuple. It also includes example usage and docstrings for clarity and documentation.
