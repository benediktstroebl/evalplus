    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

```

This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers, calculates their sum and product, and returns the results as a tuple. The function handles the edge case where the input list is empty by initializing the sum to 0 and the product to 1. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with an empty list and a non-empty list.
