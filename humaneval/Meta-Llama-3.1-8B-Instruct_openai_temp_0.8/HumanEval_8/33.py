    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the list's elements.

    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the current number to the product
        total_product *= num

print(sum_product([]))  # Expected output: (0, 1)

```

This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers, calculates the sum and product of the list's elements, and returns them as a tuple. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior for both empty lists and non-empty lists.
