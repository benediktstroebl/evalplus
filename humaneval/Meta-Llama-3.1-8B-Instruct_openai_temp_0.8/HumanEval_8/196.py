In this script, we define a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all the integers in the list. The function initializes the sum and product variables to 0 and 1, respectively, and then iterates over each number in the list, updating the sum and product accordingly. Finally, the function returns the sum and product as a tuple. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
