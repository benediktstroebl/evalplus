def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input numbers.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_product([])
        (0, 1)
        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
        (10, 24)

    # Initialize sum to 0 and product to 1
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1

    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the current number with the product
        total_product *= num

    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product

This script defines a function `sum_product` that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. It initializes the sum to 0 and the product to 1, then iterates over the list, adding each number to the sum and multiplying each number with the product. Finally, it returns the sum and product as a tuple. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
