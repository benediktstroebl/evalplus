This script defines a function `sum_product` that calculates the sum and product of a list of integers. It then provides example usage of this function. The function works by initializing a sum and product to 0 and 1 respectively, then looping over each number in the list and updating the sum and product accordingly. Finally, it returns the sum and product as a tuple.
