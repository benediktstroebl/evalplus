    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

```

This script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all the integers in the list. It uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the sum and product. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function with an empty list and a list with four elements.
