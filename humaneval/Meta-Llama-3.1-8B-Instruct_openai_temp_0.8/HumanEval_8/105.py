Here's a self-contained Python script that solves the problem in a markdown code block:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    
    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the input list.
    
    Examples:
        >>> sum_product([])
        (0, 1)
        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
        (10, 24)
    """
    # Initialize sum and product to 0 and 1 respectively
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the number to the sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the product by the number
        total_product *= num
    
    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product

# Test the function
print(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
```

This Python script defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all the integers in the list. The function initializes the sum and product to 0 and 1 respectively, then iterates over each number in the list, adding it to the sum and multiplying it into the product. Finally, it returns the sum and product as a tuple. The script also includes example use cases and a test at the end to demonstrate the function's behavior.
