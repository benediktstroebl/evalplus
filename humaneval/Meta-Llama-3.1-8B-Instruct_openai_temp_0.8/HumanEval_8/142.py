def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple consisting of sum and product of all integers in the list.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_product([])
        (0, 1)
        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
        (10, 24)

    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the sum
        total_sum += num
        # Multiply the current number with the product
        total_product *= num

This script includes a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple consisting of the sum and the product of all integers in the list. The function initializes sum and product to 0 and 1 respectively, then iterates over the list of numbers to calculate the sum and product. Finally, it returns the calculated sum and product. The script includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
