Here is the Python code that solves the problem:
```markdown
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return length of given string
    
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

This script defines a function `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The length of a string in Python is obtained by using the built-in `len` function.
