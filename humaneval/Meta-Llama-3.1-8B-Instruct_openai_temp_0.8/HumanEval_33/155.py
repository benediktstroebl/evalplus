```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The transformed list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k // 3] 
            for k, x in enumerate(l)]

# Example usage:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This function works by using a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `l`. For each element, it checks if the index is divisible by three. If it is, it selects the element at that index from the sorted list of elements at indices divisible by three. If the index is not divisible by three, it just takes the element at that index from the original list. The result is a new list with the specified properties.
