This script first separates the input list into two parts: one for indices divisible by 3 and one for indices not divisible by 3. It then sorts the part with indices divisible by 3, and finally combines the two parts back into a single list. The sorted part is placed at the indices divisible by 3, while the original values are kept at the indices not divisible by 3.
