```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Parameters:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: The modified list.
    """
    return [l[i] if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([x for x in l if x % 3 == 0])[index // 3] for i, index in enumerate(range(len(l)))]

This script uses list comprehension with a conditional statement to achieve the desired result. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the value of each element in the list. If the index is divisible by 3, it gets the corresponding value from the sorted list of elements that are divisible by 3. If the index is not divisible by 3, it simply returns the value from the original list. 

Please note that this solution uses a simple sorting approach, which might be inefficient for large lists. In such cases, you might want to consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm or a data structure like a heap. 

Also note that in Python 3.10 and above, you can use the `enumerate` function directly in the list comprehension, so the line would be `[l[i] if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([x for x in l if x % 3 == 0])[i // 3] for i in range(len(l))]`. However, since Python 3.10 list comprehension support the variable i in the "if" condition, we can simplify this to: `[l[i] if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([x for x in l if x % 3 == 0])[i // 3] for i in range(len(l))]`.
