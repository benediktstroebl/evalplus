This script defines a function `sort_third` which takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` with the values at the indices that are divisible by 3 sorted. The Python list comprehension is used to achieve this. If an index is not divisible by 3, the value at that index in `l` is taken directly, otherwise, the values at the indices that are divisible by 3 are sorted in place.
