```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The list l' as described above.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k % len([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])] for k, x in enumerate(l)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
However, the previous solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the use of list comprehension inside the outer list comprehension. Here's an improved version with a time complexity of O(n):

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The list l' as described above.
    """
    sorted_by_three = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])
    result = []
    sorted_index = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        result.append(x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted_by_three[sorted_index % len(sorted_by_three)])
        if i % 3 == 0:
            sorted_index += 1
    return result
