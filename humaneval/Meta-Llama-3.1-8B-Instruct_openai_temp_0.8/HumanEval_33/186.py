This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list according to the problem description. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and for each element, it checks if the index is divisible by 3. If it is, it sorts the elements at indices that are divisible by 3 and selects the k-th element (where k is the same as the current index `i`) from the sorted list. If the index is not divisible by 3, it simply selects the original element. The modified list is then returned.
