This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the elements at indices divisible by three are sorted. The function first separates the input list into two parts: one for indices not divisible by three, and one for indices divisible by three. It then sorts the latter list using the built-in `sort` method. Finally, it combines the two lists, replacing the elements at indices divisible by three with the sorted elements. The resulting list is returned as output.
