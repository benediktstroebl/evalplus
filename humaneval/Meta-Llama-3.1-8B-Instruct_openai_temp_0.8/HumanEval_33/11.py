```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    # Use list comprehension to create a new list with values unchanged at indices not divisible by 3
    # and sorted values at indices divisible by 3
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[j % len([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])] for i, x in enumerate(l) for j in range(10)]


# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, this solution could potentially be inefficient because it has an O(n^2) time complexity due to the nested loops and list comprehensions. A more efficient solution could be implemented using list comprehension with conditional statements and slicing:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    # Get the values at indices divisible by 3 and sort them
    sorted_values = sorted([l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0])
    
    # Use list comprehension to create a new list with values unchanged at indices not divisible by 3
    # and sorted values at indices divisible by 3
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted_values[i % len(sorted_values)] for i, x in enumerate(l)]


# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, which is more efficient than the previous solution.
