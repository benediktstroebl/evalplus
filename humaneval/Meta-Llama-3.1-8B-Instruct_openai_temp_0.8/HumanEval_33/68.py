    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for k, (i, x) in enumerate(zip(range(len(l)), l))]

# Example usage:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This script defines the `sort_third` function, which iterates through each index and value in the input list `l`. If the index is not divisible by 3, it returns the original value. If the index is divisible by 3, it sorts the values at indices divisible by 3 and returns the `k-th` value from the sorted list, where `k` is the index in the original list.

The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each element in the list. The `[y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0]` expression generates a list of values at indices divisible by 3. The `sorted` function sorts this list, and the first element (at index 0) is selected with `[k]`.

The script then demonstrates the usage of the `sort_third` function with the provided examples.
