    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for k, (i, x) in enumerate(zip(range(len(l)), l))]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This function works by iterating over the input list `l` and for each element, it checks if its index is divisible by 3. If it is, the function includes the corresponding element from the sorted list of elements at indices divisible by 3 (obtained using a list comprehension and the `sorted` function). If the index is not divisible by 3, the function simply includes the original element from the input list.
