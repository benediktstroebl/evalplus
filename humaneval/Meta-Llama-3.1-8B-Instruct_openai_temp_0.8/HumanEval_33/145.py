```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list according to the problem statement.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])[j % len([y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for j, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

Note: The original function was not a one liner as in your example and was also not well optimized, I rewrote it for better readability.
