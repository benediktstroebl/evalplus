This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list as input and returns a modified list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list. The if condition checks if the index is not divisible by 3, and if so, it returns the original value. The elif condition checks if the index is divisible by 3, and if so, it returns the corresponding value from the sorted list of values at indices that are divisible by 3.
