### Sort Third Function
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are 
    equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list based on the given criteria.
    """
    # Separate the list into two parts: one that is not divisible by three, and one that is
    not_divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    divisible_by_three = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])

    # Combine the two lists, keeping the original order
    sorted_l = []
    not_divisible_by_three_index = 0
    for i, _ in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3!= 0:
            sorted_l.append(not_divisible_by_three[not_divisible_by_three_index])
            not_divisible_by_three_index += 1
        else:
            sorted_l.append(divisible_by_three[i // 3])

    return sorted_l
```

### Example Usage:

```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
