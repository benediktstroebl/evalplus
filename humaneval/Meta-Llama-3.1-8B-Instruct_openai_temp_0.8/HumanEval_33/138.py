    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

    return [l[i-1] if (i-1) % 3!= 0 else sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])[k]

This script defines the `sort_third` function as described. It uses a list comprehension to create the modified list, iterating over the indices of the input list. For indices that are divisible by three, it selects the corresponding values from the sorted list of values at indices that are divisible by three.

Please note that the function uses `1` as the starting index for the list comprehension because list indices in Python start at `0`, but the problem description uses `1` as the starting index for the sake of simplicity.
