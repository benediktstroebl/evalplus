This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list where the elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted. The function uses list comprehension to generate the modified list. It iterates over the input list `l` with `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value `x`. If the index `i` is not divisible by 3, it assigns the original value `x` to the corresponding position in the output list. If the index `i` is divisible by 3, it sorts the values at indices divisible by 3 in the input list and assigns the `-(i % 3 - 1)`-th element of the sorted list to the corresponding position in the output list. The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior.
