This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list and returns a new list. It splits the input list into two parts using list comprehensions: one part where the index is divisible by three, and one part where it's not. The first part is then sorted using the built-in `sorted` function. Finally, the two parts are combined back together in the correct order, with the sorted part at the indices that are divisible by three.
