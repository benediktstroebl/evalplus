```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list as per the problem statement.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for k, y in enumerate(l) if y % 3 == 0 and i % 3 == 0]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the previous solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested list comprehension. Here's a more efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n):

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list as per the problem statement.
    """
    # Separate elements at indices not divisible by 3
    not_divisible_by_3 = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    # Separate and sort elements at indices divisible by 3
    divisible_by_3 = sorted([x for x in l if x % 3 == 0])
    
    # Merge the two lists while maintaining the original order
    result = []
    not_divisible_by_3_index = 0
    divisible_by_3_index = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3!= 0:
            result.append(not_divisible_by_3[not_divisible_by_3_index])
            not_divisible_by_3_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(divisible_by_3[divisible_by_3_index])
            divisible_by_3_index += 1
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```
This solution first separates the elements at indices not divisible by 3 and the elements at indices divisible by 3. Then, it merges these two lists while maintaining the original order.
