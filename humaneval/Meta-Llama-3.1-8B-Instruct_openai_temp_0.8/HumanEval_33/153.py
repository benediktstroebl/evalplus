### Sorting a List Based on Indices Divisible by Three
#### Problem Description
This problem requires us to create a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input. The output list `l'` should have the same values as the input list `l` at indices that are not divisible by three. At indices that are divisible by three, the output list `l'` should have the values of the input list `l` sorted.

#### Solution

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list according to the problem statement.
    """
    # Separate the list into two parts: one with indices divisible by 3 and one with indices not divisible by 3
    even_part = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    odd_part = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]

    # Sort the part with indices divisible by 3
    sorted_even_part = sorted(even_part)

    # Combine the two parts back into one list
    result = []
    even_index = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(sorted_even_part[even_index])
            even_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(x)

    return result

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` according to the problem statement. It first separates the input list into two parts: one with indices divisible by 3 and one with indices not divisible by 3. It then sorts the part with indices divisible by 3. Finally, it combines the two parts back into one list, replacing the values at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted values. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
