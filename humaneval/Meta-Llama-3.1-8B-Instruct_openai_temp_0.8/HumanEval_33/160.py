```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Parameters:
    l (list): The input list to be sorted.
    
    Returns:
    list: The sorted list according to the problem specification.
    """
    return [sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])[j % len(sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]))] if i % 3 == 0 else x for i, x in enumerate(l)]

# Testing the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, this script is not the most efficient solution and it is not directly following the problem description. A more efficient and straightforward way to solve the problem is as follows:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Parameters:
    l (list): The input list to be sorted.
    
    Returns:
    list: The sorted list according to the problem specification.
    """
    div_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    not_div_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted(div_by_three)[j % len(div_by_three)] for i, x in enumerate(not_div_by_three + sorted(div_by_three))]

# Testing the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This solution creates two lists, one for the elements at indices that are divisible by three and one for the elements at indices that are not divisible by three. It then combines these two lists and sorts the elements at the divisible by three indices while preserving the other elements' order.
