This script defines a function `sort_third` which takes a list as input, and returns a new list where values at indices not divisible by 3 are the same as in the input list, and at indices divisible by 3, the function sorts the corresponding values from the input list and takes the smallest one.

The function uses list comprehension to create a new list based on the conditions. It first checks if the index is divisible by 3. If it's not, the value from the input list is kept. If it is, the function sorts the corresponding values from the input list (filtered to be equal to or greater than the original value at the index divisible by 3, and also divisible by 3) and takes the smallest one.

The script then tests the function with the given examples to demonstrate its correctness.
