```python
def sort_third(lst: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list lst and returns a list lst' such that
    lst' is identical to lst in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of lst, but sorted.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(lst) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for k, i, x in enumerate(lst)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list. For each index `i` in the list, it checks if `i` is divisible by 3. If not, it simply includes the value at that index in the output list. If `i` is divisible by 3, it includes the `k`-th value from the sorted list of elements at indices that are divisible by 3, where `k` is the same as the current index `i`. 

Note that the `sorted` function sorts the entire list of values that are divisible by 3, and then the list comprehension iterates over these sorted values to select the corresponding value for each index divisible by 3. 

Alternatively, you could use the `itertools.filterfalse` and `itertools.compress` functions to make the code more concise and Pythonic:

```python
from itertools import filterfalse,_compress

def sort_third(lst: list) -> list:
    values_at_divisible_indices = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if i % 3 == 0])
    return list(_compress(lst, _filterfalse(lambda i: i % 3 == 0, range(len(lst)))))
```

This solution first creates the list of values at indices that are divisible by 3, sorts it, and then uses `itertools.filterfalse` to create an iterator over the indices that are not divisible by 3. `itertools.compress` is then used to select the corresponding values from the input list.
