```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([j for j, v in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range(len([j for j, v in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0]))]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, this solution has a flaw: it can be very inefficient if the list is large, because it involves multiple list comprehensions and a sort operation. Here's a more efficient solution that keeps track of the sorted values at the indices divisible by 3, and uses these values in the final list:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store the values at indices divisible by 3 and their sorted order
    sorted_values = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0}
    
    # Sort the values
    sorted_values = dict(sorted(sorted_values.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
    
    # Create the result list
    result = []
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(list(sorted_values.keys())[sorted_values[x]])
        else:
            result.append(x)
    
    return result

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
