    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

This script accomplishes the task by first separating the input list into two parts: one with indices not divisible by three, and one with indices divisible by three. It then sorts the second list and inserts the sorted elements at their original positions in the first list. Note that this script uses 0-based indexing, so the `i // 3` in the `sorted_third.pop()` line is used to calculate the correct position to pop the element from the sorted list.
