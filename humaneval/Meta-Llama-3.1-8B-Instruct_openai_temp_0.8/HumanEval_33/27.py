```

This script meets the requirements of the problem, sorting the list at indices divisible by three while leaving other indices unchanged. The function `sort_third` uses list comprehensions to separate the list into two parts and sort the values at indices divisible by three. It then combines these parts to form the final result. The test cases demonstrate the function's correctness.
