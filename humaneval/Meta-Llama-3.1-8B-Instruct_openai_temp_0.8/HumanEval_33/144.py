### Sort Third
#### Problem Description

This problem requires writing a function in Python that takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l'` where the values at indices that are divisible by 3 are sorted, while the values at other indices remain unchanged.

#### Solution

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list according to the problem description.
    """
    # Separate the elements into two lists: one for indices not divisible by 3, 
    # and one for indices divisible by 3
    not_divisible = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    divisible = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Sort the list of elements at indices that are divisible by 3
    divisible.sort()
    
    # Combine the two lists, inserting the sorted elements at their correct positions
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    for k in range(len(l)):
        if k % 3 == 0:
            result.append(divisible[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(not_divisible[j])
            j += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

#### Explanation

This solution uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into two lists: one for elements at indices not divisible by 3 and one for elements at indices divisible by 3. It then sorts the list of elements at indices divisible by 3. Finally, it combines the two lists by iterating over the original list and inserting the sorted elements at their correct positions.

This approach ensures that the values at indices not divisible by 3 remain unchanged, while the values at indices divisible by 3 are sorted.
