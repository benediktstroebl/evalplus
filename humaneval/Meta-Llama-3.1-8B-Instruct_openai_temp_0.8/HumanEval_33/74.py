    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with elements at every third index sorted.

This script uses list comprehension with conditional statements to sort every third element of the input list. It iterates through the list with the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and value of each element. If the index is not divisible by three, it keeps the element as it is. If the index is divisible by three, it sorts the elements at the same index and keeps the corresponding sorted element. If there is an index that is divisible by three and it's the last index of the corresponding list, it keeps the original element of the list at that index.
