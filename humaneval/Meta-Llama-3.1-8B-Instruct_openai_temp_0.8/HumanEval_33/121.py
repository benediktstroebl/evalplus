This script defines the function `sort_third` as specified and includes two test cases to verify its correctness. The function works by first separating the input list `l` into two parts: one for indices not divisible by three, and one for indices divisible by three. It then sorts the list for indices divisible by three. Finally, it combines the two lists, filling the positions for indices divisible by three with the sorted values.
