```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list according to the problem statement.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range(len([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])) if i % 3 == 0]

# Testing the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, this code can be simplified by avoiding the explicit list comprehension and using the `sort()` function to sort the list in-place. 

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list according to the problem statement.
    """
    temp = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else temp[k % len(temp)] for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range(len(l))]

# Testing the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This version of the function still maintains the O(n) time complexity.
