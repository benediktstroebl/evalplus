```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range(len([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0]))]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the above solution is not efficient and can be optimized. Here's a more efficient implementation:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    values_at_three = [x for x in l if x % 3 == 0]
    sorted_at_three = sorted(values_at_three)
    
    result = []
    index_at_three = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(sorted_at_three[index_at_three])
            index_at_three += 1
        else:
            result.append(x)
    
    return result

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This version has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list, and it uses a constant amount of space, making it more efficient than the previous solution.
