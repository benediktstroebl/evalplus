This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list as an input and returns a new list with the values at indices divisible by three sorted. It first separates the list into two parts, one with indices not divisible by three and one with indices divisible by three. It then sorts the list of values at indices divisible by three and fills in these values in the result list, replacing the original values.
