    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

        l (list): The input list to be processed.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with elements at indices divisible by 3 sorted.

This script defines a function `sort_third` that solves the problem described. It works by first separating the input list into two lists: one for elements at indices divisible by 3 and another for elements at other indices. It then sorts the elements at indices divisible by 3. Finally, it combines these two lists and returns the result.

When you run this script, it will print the output of the function for the two test cases provided in the problem description.
