This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list `l'`. The function separates the input list into two lists: one for indices not divisible by three and one for indices divisible by three. It then combines these two lists in the same order as the original list, but with the values at indices divisible by three sorted. The function returns the modified list. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
