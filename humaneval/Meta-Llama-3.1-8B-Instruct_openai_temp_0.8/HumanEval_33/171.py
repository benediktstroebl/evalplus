This script defines the `sort_third` function, which sorts the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3 in the input list, while keeping the other elements unchanged. The function uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into three parts: one for indices that are not divisible by 3, one for indices that are divisible by 3 sorted, and one that will be concatenated at the end. The function then iterates over the input list, appending the elements from the corresponding parts to the result list. The function returns the result list.
