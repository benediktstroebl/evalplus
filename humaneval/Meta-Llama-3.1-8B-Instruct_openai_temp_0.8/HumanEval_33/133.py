This script defines the `sort_third` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list with the same elements at indices that are not divisible by three, but with the elements at indices that are divisible by three sorted. It uses list comprehensions and the `sorted` function to achieve this. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
