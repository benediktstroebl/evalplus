This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l'` as per the given problem statement. It uses list comprehension to separate the elements of `l` into two lists: one for indices not divisible by 3 and one for indices divisible by 3. It sorts the list of elements at indices divisible by 3 and then uses another list comprehension to create `l'` by combining the unsorted elements with the sorted elements at the correct indices. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
