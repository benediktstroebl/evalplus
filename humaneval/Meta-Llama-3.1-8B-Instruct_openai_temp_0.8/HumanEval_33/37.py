This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the modified list. It uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list, checking if the index is divisible by 3. If it's not, the value is taken as is. If it is, the value is taken from the sorted list of values at indices divisible by 3. The script then tests the function with the provided examples.
