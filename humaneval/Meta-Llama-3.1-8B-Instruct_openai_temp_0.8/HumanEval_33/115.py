### sort_third Function

This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that
`l'` is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.

#### Code
```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate the list into three parts: those at indices divisible by 3, 
    # those at indices not divisible by 3, and those that would be at indices 
    # divisible by 3 if we were considering all numbers, not just the list's length.
    every_third = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if (i + 1) % 3 == 0]
    non_third = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if (i + 1) % 3!= 0]
    middle_third = every_third + [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if (i + 1) % 3 == 1] + every_third
    
    # Sort the every_third list.
    every_third.sort()
    
    # Combine the three lists to get the final result.
    result = [None] * len(l)
    result[::3] = every_third
    result[1::3] = [x for i, x in enumerate(non_third) if (i + 1) % 3 == 1]
    result[2::3] = non_third
    
    return result
```

#### Example Use Cases
```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
