### Sorting Elements Divisible by 3 in a List
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate elements at indices divisible by 3
    div3_elements = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    # Sort the separated elements
    div3_elements.sort()
    # Initialize the result list
    result = []
    # Initialize the index for the separated elements
    div3_index = 0
    # Iterate over the input list
    for i in range(len(l)):
        # If the index is divisible by 3, append the sorted element
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(div3_elements[div3_index])
            div3_index += 1
        # Otherwise, append the original element
        else:
            result.append(l[i])
    return result

# Example use cases:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
This script uses list comprehension to separate the elements at indices divisible by 3, sorts them, and then iterates over the original list to construct the result list. The result list maintains the original elements at indices not divisible by 3, while replacing the elements at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted separated elements.
