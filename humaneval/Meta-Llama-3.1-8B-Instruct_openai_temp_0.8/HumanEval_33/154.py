### Sort Third Function
```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be processed.

    Returns:
        list: The processed list.
    """
    # Use list comprehension to create two separate lists: one with values at indices not divisible by three and one with values at indices divisible by three
    not_divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]

    # Sort the list of values at indices divisible by three
    divisible_by_three.sort()

    # Concatenate the two lists to get the final result
    result = not_divisible_by_three + divisible_by_three

    return result


# Test cases

print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))

This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list as input, creates two separate lists (one for indices not divisible by three and one for indices divisible by three), sorts the list of values at indices divisible by three, and then concatenates the two lists to get the final result. The script also includes two test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
