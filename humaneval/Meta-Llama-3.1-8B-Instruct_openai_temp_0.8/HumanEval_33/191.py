This script defines the `sort_third` function and tests it with the provided example use cases. The function takes a list `l`, separates it into two parts (elements at indices divisible by 3 and the rest), sorts the first part, and then combines the two parts in the original order. The result is a list where elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted.
