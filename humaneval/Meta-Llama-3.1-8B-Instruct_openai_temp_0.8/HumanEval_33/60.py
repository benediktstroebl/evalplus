    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

This script defines the function `sort_third` which takes a list `l` as input. It iterates over the list, and for each element, it checks if its index is divisible by 3. If it is, it sorts the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3 and replaces the element at the current index with the sorted element at the same index. If the index is not divisible by 3, it leaves the element unchanged. The function then returns the modified list. The script includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
