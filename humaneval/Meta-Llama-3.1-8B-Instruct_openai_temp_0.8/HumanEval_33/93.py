```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
    l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
    list: The modified list.
    """
    
    # Use list comprehension to create a new list where values at indices divisible by 3 are sorted
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k // 3] for i, x in enumerate(l) for k, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

Note: The solution uses list comprehension to generate the new list. It first separates the values that are at indices divisible by 3 and sorts them. Then, for each index divisible by 3, it replaces the value with the corresponding sorted value. For indices not divisible by 3, it leaves the value unchanged. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the sorting operation.
