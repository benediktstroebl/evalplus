This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list where the values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted. The function uses list comprehension and the `enumerate` function to iterate over the input list and its indices. It uses another list comprehension to filter out the values at indices that are divisible by three and sort them. The sorted values are then used to replace the original values at the same indices in the output list.
