```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for k, i, x in enumerate(l)]

# Test the function
assert sort_third([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

Note: This function uses list comprehension to create the new list. The list comprehension iterates over the input list `l`, and for each element `x` at index `i`, it checks if `i` is not divisible by 3. If it's not, `x` is kept as is. If `i` is divisible by 3, `x` is replaced with the `k`th element of the sorted list of elements at indices that are also divisible by 3.
