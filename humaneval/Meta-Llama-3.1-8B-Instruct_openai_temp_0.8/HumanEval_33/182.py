```python

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

This script defines the function `sort_third` and includes the provided docstring. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list where elements at indices not divisible by three are copied as is, and elements at indices divisible by three are replaced with the sorted values from the corresponding indices in the original list. The function is then tested with the provided example inputs.
