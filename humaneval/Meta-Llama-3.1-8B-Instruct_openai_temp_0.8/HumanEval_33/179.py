This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the values at the indices that are divisible by three are sorted. It separates the input list into three parts: the part that is not divisible by three, the part that is divisible by three, and the remaining part. The three parts are then interleaved to get the final result. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
