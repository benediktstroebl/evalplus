This script defines the function `sort_third` and includes test cases to verify its correctness. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list where elements at indices not divisible by 3 are copied from the original list, and elements at indices divisible by 3 are replaced with the corresponding sorted values from the original list. The `unittest` module is used to write test cases and ensure the function works as intended.
