    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list according to the problem description.

            for j, i, k in enumerate(zip(range(len(l)), range(len(l)), l))]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]

This script uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices, values of the input list. For indices that are divisible by 3, it selects the corresponding values from the sorted list of values that are divisible by 3. For indices that are not divisible by 3, it selects the original value. The use of `j // 3` ensures that we select the correct value from the sorted list when there are duplicate values at indices that are divisible by 3.
