```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list

    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[i // 3 - 1] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l)]

This script uses a list comprehension to create the modified list. It checks if each index is divisible by 3, and if so, it sorts the values in the list that are divisible by 3 and selects the value at the corresponding index in the sorted list. If the index is not divisible by 3, it leaves the value unchanged.
