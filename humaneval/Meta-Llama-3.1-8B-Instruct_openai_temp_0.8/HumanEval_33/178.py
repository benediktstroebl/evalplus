### Sort Third Function
#### Description
The following Python script defines a function called `sort_third` that takes a list as input, sorts the elements at indices that are multiples of 3, and returns the resulting list.

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
    l (list): The input list
    
    Returns:
    list: The list with elements at indices divisible by 3 sorted
    """
    # Use list comprehension to create a new list where the elements at indices not divisible by 3 remain the same
    # and the elements at indices divisible by 3 are replaced with their sorted values
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[i // 3 - 1] for i, x in enumerate(l)]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This script uses list comprehension to create a new list. For each element in the original list, it checks if the index is divisible by 3. If it is, the element is replaced with the corresponding sorted value. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each element in the list. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which returns the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are not taken into account. The list comprehension `[y for y in l if y % 3 == 0]` creates a list of all elements in the original list that are divisible by 3, and `sorted(...)[i // 3 - 1]` sorts this list and returns the element at the index that corresponds to the current index `i`.
