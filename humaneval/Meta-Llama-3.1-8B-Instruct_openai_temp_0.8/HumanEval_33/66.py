This script uses list comprehension and the modulo operator (`%`) to iterate over the input list and index. If the current index `i` is not divisible by 3, the value from the original list is simply copied over. If `i` is divisible by 3, a new list comprehension is used to create a list of values at indices that are also divisible by 3, which are then sorted.
