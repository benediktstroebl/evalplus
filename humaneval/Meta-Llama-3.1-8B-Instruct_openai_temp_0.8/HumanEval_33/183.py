This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list as input and returns a new list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices and values of the input list. If the index is not divisible by 3, it simply returns the value at that index. If the index is divisible by 3, it creates a new list of all values at indices divisible by 3, sorts them, and returns the value at the same index in the sorted list. The test cases are included at the end to verify that the function works correctly.
