    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

This script uses a list comprehension to create the modified list. It checks if the index `i` is divisible by 3. If not, it simply uses the value at index `i` from the original list. If `i` is divisible by 3, it sorts the values at the same index from the original list and uses the `j`-th value from the sorted list. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index `i` and the current index `j` from the `l` list.
