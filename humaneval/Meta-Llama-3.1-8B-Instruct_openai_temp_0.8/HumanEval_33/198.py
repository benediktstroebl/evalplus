    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three,

    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

This Python script takes an input list `l` and returns a new list where the values at indices that are divisible by 3 are replaced by the sorted values at those indices. The rest of the list remains unchanged. The list comprehension iterates over the input list `l`, using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value at that index. If the index `i` is not divisible by 3, it simply includes the current value in the new list. If the index `i` is divisible by 3, it includes the smallest value from the elements at the current index and all other elements that are divisible by 3.
