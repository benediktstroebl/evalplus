### Sorting Elements at Indices Divisible by Three

This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.

#### Code
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The list l' as specified above.
    """
    # Separate the list into two parts: one for indices divisible by 3, 
    # and one for the rest of the indices
    sorted_part = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])
    rest_part = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    
    # Combine the two parts to form the final list
    result = []
    sorted_idx = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(sorted_part[sorted_idx])
            sorted_idx += 1
        else:
            result.append(x)
    
    return result

# Example use cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
#### Explanation

This function works by first separating the list into two parts: one for indices divisible by 3, and one for the rest of the indices. The part for indices divisible by 3 is sorted, and then the two parts are combined to form the final list. The final list is constructed by iterating over the original list and replacing elements at indices divisible by 3 with the corresponding sorted elements.
