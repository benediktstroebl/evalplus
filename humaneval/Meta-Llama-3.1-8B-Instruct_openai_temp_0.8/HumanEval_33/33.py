However, the code above can be improved by using list comprehension and the `itertools.islice` function to make it more concise and efficient.

```python
import itertools

def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Parameters:
    l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
    list: The modified list.
    
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Separate the list into two parts: elements at indices divisible by 3 and others
