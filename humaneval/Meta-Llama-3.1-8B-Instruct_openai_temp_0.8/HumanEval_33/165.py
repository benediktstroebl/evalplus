### Sort Third Function
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate the list into three parts
    part1 = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    part2 = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])
    
    # Combine the parts to get the result
    result = []
    part2_index = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(part2[part2_index])
            part2_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(x)
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```
This script defines the `sort_third` function, which separates the input list into three parts: one for indices not divisible by three, one for indices divisible by three, and sorts the second part. It then combines the parts in the correct order to get the result. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
