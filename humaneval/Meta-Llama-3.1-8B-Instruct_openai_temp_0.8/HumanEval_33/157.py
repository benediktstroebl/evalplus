This script uses list comprehensions to separate the list `l` into two parts: one where the index is not divisible by 3 (`not_divisible`) and one where it is (`divisible`). It then sorts the values in `divisible` using the `sorted` function and `enumerate` to keep track of the original indices. Finally, it combines the two parts to produce the desired result.
