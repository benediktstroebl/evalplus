```python
def sort_third(l: list):

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three,
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The transformed list.

            for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range((i % 3 == 0) + 1)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]

This script uses a list comprehension to create the transformed list. The outer list comprehension iterates over the input list, and for each element, it checks if the current index is divisible by 3. If it is, it selects the corresponding values from the list that are also divisible by 3, sorts them, and selects the k-th element from the sorted list. If the index is not divisible by 3, it simply selects the original element.
