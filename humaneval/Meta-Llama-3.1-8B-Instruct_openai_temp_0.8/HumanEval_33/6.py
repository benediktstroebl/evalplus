```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): Input list.

    Returns:
        list: Output list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])[j] for i, x in enumerate(l) for j in range(len([y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])) if i % 3 == 0]


# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the previous solution can be simplified and optimized by directly sorting the elements at indices divisible by 3 and then inserting them into the output list at their original positions.

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): Input list.

    Returns:
        list: Output list.
    """
    sorted_elements = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])
    result = []
    j = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3!= 0:
            result.append(x)
        else:
            result.append(sorted_elements[j])
            j += 1
    return result


# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```
This version of the function has a time complexity of O(n log k), where n is the length of the input list and k is the number of elements at indices divisible by 3. This is because it sorts these elements separately, which takes O(k log k) time, and then iterates over the input list once, which takes O(n) time. The space complexity is also O(n + k) because it creates two lists: one for the sorted elements and one for the output list.
