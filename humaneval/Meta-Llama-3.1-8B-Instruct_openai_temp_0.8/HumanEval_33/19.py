This script defines the `sort_third` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a list `l'` that satisfies the given conditions. The function first separates the input list into two sublists: one for indices divisible by 3 and the other for indices not divisible by 3. It then sorts the sublist corresponding to indices divisible by 3. Finally, it combines the sorted sublist with the original sublist, replacing the values at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted values. The resulting list is returned.
