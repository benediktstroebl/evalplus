This script defines a function `sort_third` that implements the described logic. It first separates the input list into three parts: elements not divisible by 3, elements at index 1 that are divisible by 3, and elements at index 2 that are divisible by 3. Each of these parts is then sorted using the `sorted` function. The three sorted parts are then combined back into a single list using the `+` operator. The function returns this sorted list. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the function.
