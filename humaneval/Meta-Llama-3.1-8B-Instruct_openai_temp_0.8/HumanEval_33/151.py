```python

    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
    l (list): The input list to be sorted at third positions.
    
    Returns:
    list: The list l' with values at third positions sorted.
    """
    result = []
    for i, val in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:  # If index is divisible by 3
            if len(result) > i // 3:  # If list already has elements at this position
                result.append(result[i // 3])  # Append the already sorted element
            else:
                result.append(val)  # Otherwise append the unsorted element
        else:  # If index is not divisible by 3
            result.append(val)  # Just append the unsorted element
    
    # Sort elements at third positions
    for i in range(len(result)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result[i] = sorted([result[i] if i < len(result) else None for i in range(len(result))])[i]
    
    return result

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

Please note that the approach used in this solution involves two separate passes over the list: one to construct the list and another to sort the elements at third positions. This is because we can't sort the elements in-place while iterating over the list as we're also modifying the list based on its current state.
