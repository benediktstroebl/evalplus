This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `input_list` as input, sorts the elements at indices divisible by three, and leaves the rest unchanged. The function uses a combination of list comprehension and the `enumerate` function to achieve this. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's correctness.
