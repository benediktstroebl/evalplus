### Sort Third Function

This script implements a function `sort_third` that sorts the elements at indices divisible by three in a given list.

#### Code

```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate elements at indices divisible and not divisible by three
    divisible = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    non_divisible = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3!= 0]

    # Sort the elements at indices divisible by three
    divisible.sort()

    # Combine the sorted elements with non-divisible elements
    result = [None] * len(l)
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result[i] = divisible[i // 3]
        else:
            result[i] = non_divisible[i // 3]

    return result
```

#### Example Usage

```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
