### Python Script to Sort Thirds
```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three,
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with values at indices divisible by three sorted.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] for k, i, x in enumerate(l)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
This script defines the `sort_third` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list with values at indices divisible by three sorted. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and for each index `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by three. If it's not, it leaves the value at `x` unchanged. If it is, it sorts the values at indices divisible by three and assigns the `k`-th value from the sorted list to `x`, where `k` is the original index `i`.
