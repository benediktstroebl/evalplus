This script defines the `sort_third` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` according to the problem's requirements. It uses list comprehension to generate `l'`. The list comprehension checks if the index `i` is divisible by three; if it is, it uses another list comprehension to find the corresponding sorted value in `l`. If `i` is not divisible by three, it simply copies the value from `l`. The function is then tested with the provided example cases.
