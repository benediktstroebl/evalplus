### Sort Third Function

This script implements the `sort_third` function in Python.

#### Code

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be processed.

    Returns:
        list: The processed list.
    """
    # Separate elements at indices divisible by 3 and those not divisible by 3
    elements_at_indices_divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    elements_at_indices_not_divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]

    # Sort elements at indices divisible by 3
    sorted_elements_at_indices_divisible_by_three = sorted(elements_at_indices_divisible_by_three)

    # Combine sorted and unsorted elements
    result = []
    i = 0
    for x in l:
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(sorted_elements_at_indices_divisible_by_three[i // 3])
        else:
            result.append(x)
        i += 1

    return result

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

#### Explanation

1. The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input.
2. It separates elements at indices divisible by 3 from those not divisible by 3 using list comprehension.
3. It sorts the elements at indices divisible by 3 using the `sorted` function.
4. It combines the sorted and unsorted elements to create the result list.
5. The function returns the processed list.
6. The script includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
