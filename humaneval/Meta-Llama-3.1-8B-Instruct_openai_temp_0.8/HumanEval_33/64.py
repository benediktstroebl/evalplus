This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the values at the indices that are divisible by three are sorted. The function first separates the input list into two lists: one with indices divisible by three and one with indices not divisible by three. It then sorts the list with indices divisible by three. Finally, it fills the result list with the sorted values at the indices divisible by three and the original values at the indices not divisible by three.
