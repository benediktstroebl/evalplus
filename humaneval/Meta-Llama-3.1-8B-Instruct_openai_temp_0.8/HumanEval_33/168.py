This script defines the function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` and returns a new list where the values at the indices that are divisible by three are sorted. The function uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into three parts, sort the values at the indices that are divisible by three, and then combine the three lists into one. The test cases at the end of the script demonstrate the function's behavior.
