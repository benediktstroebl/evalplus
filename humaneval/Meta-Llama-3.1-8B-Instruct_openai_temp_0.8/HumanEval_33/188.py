### Sort Third Function

#### Description
This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` where values at indices divisible by three are sorted.

#### Code
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list with values at indices divisible by three sorted.
    """
    # Separate the list into three sublists: one with indices divisible by 3, one with indices not divisible by 3, and one with indices divisible by 3 (for sorting)
    div_3 = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    not_div_3 = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    div_3_sort = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Sort the values at indices divisible by 3
    div_3_sort.sort()
    
    # Combine the sublists back into a single list
    result = []
    div_3_index = 0
    not_div_3_index = 0
    
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(div_3_sort[div_3_index])
            div_3_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(not_div_3[not_div_3_index])
            not_div_3_index += 1
            
    return result

### Example Usage
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

#### Explanation
This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` where values at indices divisible by three are sorted. The function works by separating the input list into three sublists: one with indices divisible by 3, one with indices not divisible by 3, and one with indices divisible by 3 (for sorting). The values at indices divisible by 3 are sorted and then combined with the other two sublists in the correct order to produce the final result.
