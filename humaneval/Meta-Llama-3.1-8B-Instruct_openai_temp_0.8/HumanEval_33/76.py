### Python Script to Sort Elements at Indices Divisible by Three

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that 
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate the list into two sublists: one for indices not divisible by three and one for indices divisible by three
    not_divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]

    # Sort the sublist for indices divisible by three
    divisible_by_three.sort()

    # Combine the two sublists back into one list, maintaining the original order
    result = [None] * len(l)
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3!= 0:
            result[i] = not_divisible_by_three.pop(0)
        else:
            result[i] = divisible_by_three.pop(0)

    # Replace the None values with the remaining elements from the 'not_divisible_by_three' list
    while not_divisible_by_three:
        i = 0
        while i < len(l) and result[i] is not None:
            i += 1
        result[i] = not_divisible_by_three.pop(0)

    return result


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

### Explanation

This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list `l'`. The function separates the input list into two sublists: one for indices not divisible by three and one for indices divisible by three. It then sorts the sublist for indices divisible by three and combines the two sublists back into one list, maintaining the original order. Finally, it replaces any `None` values in the result list with the remaining elements from the 'not_divisible_by_three' list. The script includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
