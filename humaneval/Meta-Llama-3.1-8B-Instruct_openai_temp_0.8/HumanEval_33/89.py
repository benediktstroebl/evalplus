This script uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list `l` and create a new list `l'`. For each element `x` in `l`, if the index `i` is not divisible by 3, then `x` remains unchanged. If the index `i` is divisible by 3, then `x` is replaced by the `k-th` element of the sorted list of elements in `l` whose indices are divisible by 3. The value of `k` is determined by the current index `i` in the outer list comprehension. This ensures that the elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted in ascending order.
