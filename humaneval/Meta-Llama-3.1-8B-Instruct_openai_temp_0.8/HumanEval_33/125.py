```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function takes a list lst and returns a list lst' such that
    lst' is identical to lst in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of lst, but sorted.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    return [val if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([val for j, val in enumerate(lst) if j % 3 == 0])[k // 3]
            for i, val in enumerate(lst) for k in range(i % 3)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the above solution may not be the most efficient way to solve this problem. Here is a more efficient solution that uses list comprehension to filter and sort the values at indices that are divisible by three:

```python
def sort_third(lst):
    """This function takes a list lst and returns a list lst' such that
    lst' is identical to lst in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of lst, but sorted.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    sorted_values = sorted([val for i, val in enumerate(lst) if i % 3 == 0])
    return [val if i % 3!= 0 else sorted_values[k // 3] for i, val in enumerate(lst) for k in range(i % 3)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity is O(n) as well, as we create a new list with the same number of elements.
