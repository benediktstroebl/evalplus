### Python Script: Sort Third Function
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be modified.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with values at indices divisible by three sorted.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[i % 3] for i, x in enumerate(l)]


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

**Explanation:**
This script uses list comprehension to create a new list that meets the specified conditions. It iterates over the input list `l` with the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` at each position. If the index `i` is not divisible by three (`i % 3!= 0`), it keeps the value as is. If the index `i` is divisible by three (`i % 3 == 0`), it sorts the values in `l` that are also divisible by three, and takes the value at the same position in the sorted list.

**Note:** This solution assumes that the input list `l` contains only integers. If the input list can contain other types of elements, you may need to modify the solution accordingly.
