### Python Function to Sort Elements at Indices Divisible by Three
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    # Separate elements at indices divisible by three and not
    elements_at_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    elements_not_at_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]

    # Sort elements at indices divisible by three
    elements_at_three.sort()

    # Combine the two lists, with elements at indices divisible by three in their sorted order
    result = [x for x in elements_not_at_three] + elements_at_three

    return result


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This script uses a list comprehension to separate elements at indices divisible by three from elements at other indices. It then sorts the elements at indices divisible by three using the built-in `sort()` method. Finally, it combines the two lists in the desired order using another list comprehension, returning the result.
