    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The resulting list

```

This script defines the `sort_third` function as specified, then tests it with the provided test cases. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `l`. For each index `i` and value `x` in `l`, it checks if `i` is divisible by 3. If it is, it sorts the values at indices divisible by 3 and takes the last one (which is the maximum, in the case of the second test case). If `i` is not divisible by 3, it leaves `x` unchanged.
