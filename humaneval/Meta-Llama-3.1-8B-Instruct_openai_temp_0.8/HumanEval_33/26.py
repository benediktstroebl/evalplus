```python

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.

print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]

This Python script uses list comprehension to split the input list into two parts: elements at indices not divisible by three and those that are. It then concatenates these two parts together, with the elements at indices divisible by three being sorted. The `enumerate` function is used to iterate over both the index and value of each element in the list.
