    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three,

    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list l'.

```

This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list with the same elements at indices not divisible by three, but with the elements at indices divisible by three sorted. The solution uses a list comprehension to achieve this. The test cases at the end verify that the function works correctly.
