```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): Input list to be sorted by thirds.

    Returns:
        list: The list with values at indicies divisible by three sorted.

    Examples:
        >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
        [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the values at indices divisible by three are sorted. The function uses list comprehensions to create two separate lists: one for values at indices not divisible by three and one for values at indices divisible by three. It then sorts the list of values at indices divisible by three and combines the two lists to create the output list. The function is tested with the provided examples using the `print` function.
