```python

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

            for k, (i, x) in enumerate(zip(range(len(l)), l))]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]

```

This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list `l'` as described in the problem statement. The function uses list comprehension and the built-in `sorted` function to create the desired list. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
