### Third Index Sorting
#### Problem Description

This problem requires sorting specific elements of a list while preserving the original order of all other elements.

#### Solution

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be processed.

    Returns:
        list: The resulting list after sorting the elements at indices divisible by three.
    """
    # Separate the list into two parts: elements at indices divisible by 3 and the rest
    sorted_third = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 2])
    # Combine the two lists, keeping the original order of elements not at indices divisible by 3
    result = [x if i % 3!= 2 else sorted_third.pop(0) for i, x in enumerate(l)]
    return result

# Example usage
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This script first separates the input list into two parts: elements at indices divisible by 3 and the rest. It then sorts the elements at indices divisible by 3. Finally, it combines the two lists, keeping the original order of elements not at indices divisible by 3.
