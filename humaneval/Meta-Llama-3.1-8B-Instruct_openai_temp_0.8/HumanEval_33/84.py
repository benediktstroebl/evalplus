```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range(l.count(x) // 3)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the provided test cases in the problem hint towards a more efficient solution that doesn't require sorting the elements at the indices divisible by 3 for each occurrence of an element at an index divisible by 3. Here's a revised implementation:
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    div3 = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])
    odd = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else div3[k] for i, x in enumerate(odd + div3)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```
This revised solution first creates two lists, `div3` and `odd`, where `div3` contains the elements at the indices divisible by 3 in sorted order and `odd` contains the elements at the indices not divisible by 3 in their original order. It then constructs the output list by alternating between the elements in `div3` and `odd`.
