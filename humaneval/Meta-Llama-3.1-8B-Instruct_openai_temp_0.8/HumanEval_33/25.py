This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input. It separates the elements at every third index into one list (`thirds`) and the rest into another list (`others`). Then it sorts the elements at every third index. Finally, it combines the sorted `thirds` with the `others` in the same order as the original list, filling in the elements at every third index with the sorted values. The function returns this modified list. The test cases demonstrate the function's behavior with the provided examples.
