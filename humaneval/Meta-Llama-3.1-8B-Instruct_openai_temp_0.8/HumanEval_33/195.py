```python

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: The modified list.

This script uses list comprehension to create a new list where the values at indices that are not divisible by 3 remain unchanged, and the values at indices that are divisible by 3 are replaced by the sorted values from the corresponding indices in the original list.
