### Python Script to Sort Thirds

```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list according to the problem statement.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for k, i, x in enumerate(l)]

# Example use cases:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This script defines the `sort_third` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list with the values at indices divisible by 3 sorted. It uses a list comprehension to create the new list, where the value at each index is either the original value (if the index is not divisible by 3) or the kth smallest value from the original values at indices divisible by 3, where k is the index in the new list.
