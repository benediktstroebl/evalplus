Here's a Python script that implements the `sort_third` function:
```markdown
# Problem: Sort elements at indices divisible by 3

### Code
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three,
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate elements at indices divisible by 3 into a separate list
    div_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    # Sort this list
    div_three.sort()
    # Replace elements at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted elements
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l[i] = div_three.pop(0)
    return l
```

### Example Use Cases
```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
