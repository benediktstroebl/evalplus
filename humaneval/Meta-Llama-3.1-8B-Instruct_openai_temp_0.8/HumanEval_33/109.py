    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

In this script, we use list comprehension to create a new list `l'` that meets the specified conditions. The expression `x if i % 3!= 0 else...` ensures that the values at indices not divisible by three remain unchanged. The expression `sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k]` sorts the values at indices divisible by three and selects the `k-th` value (where `k` is the index of the current element in `l`).
