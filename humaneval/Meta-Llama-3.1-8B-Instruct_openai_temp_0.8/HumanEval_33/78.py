```python

    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to create a new list
    # The while indices are unchanged
    # The values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[j // 3] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0]


# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, this code is not efficient at all. It should be optimized for time complexity.

Here's the optimized version:

```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate the list into three lists: one for values not divisible by three, 
    # one for values divisible by three, and one for the indices of the values 
    # that are divisible by three
    not_divisible, divisible, indices = [], [], []
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3!= 0:
            not_divisible.append(x)
        else:
            divisible.append(x)
            indices.append(i)

    # Sort the values that are divisible by three
    sorted_divisible = sorted(divisible)

    # Replace the values in the original list with the sorted values
    for i in indices:
        l[i] = sorted_divisible.pop(0)

    return l


# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This optimized version has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, which is better than the original version with a time complexity of O(n^2).
