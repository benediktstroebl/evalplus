This script uses a list comprehension to iterate over both the list and the indices. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by 3. If it's not, it keeps the original value. If it is, it sorts the values at indices divisible by 3 and returns the corresponding sorted value. Note that this solution assumes that the list is not empty and that indices are 0-indexed. If the list can be empty, you might need to add a special case to handle this.
