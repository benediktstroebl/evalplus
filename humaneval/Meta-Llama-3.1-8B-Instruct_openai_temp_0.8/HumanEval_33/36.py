This script defines the `sort_third` function, which takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list that meets the specified conditions. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list, iterating over the input list and checking each index. If the index is not divisible by three, the value is taken as is. If the index is divisible by three, the value is the sorted value at the corresponding position in the list of values whose indices are divisible by three. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
