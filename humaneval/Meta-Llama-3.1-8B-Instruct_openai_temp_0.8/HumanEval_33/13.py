This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list `l'`. It divides the list into two parts: the part that remains unchanged and the part that needs to be sorted. It then sorts the `to_sort` part and combines it with the `unchanged` part to produce the final result. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
