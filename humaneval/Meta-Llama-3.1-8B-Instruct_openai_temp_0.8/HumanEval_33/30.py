```python

    """
    This function takes a list lst and returns a list lst' such that
    lst' is identical to lst in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of lst, but sorted.

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.

    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(lst) if j % 3 == 0])[k] for i, x in enumerate(lst) for k in range((lst // 3) + (lst % 3 > 0))]


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))

```

However, the previous response was not the most efficient way to solve this problem. Here's an improved solution with better time complexity.

```python
def sort_third(lst: list) -> list:

    lst' is identical to lst in the indices that are not divisible by three,

    Args:
        lst (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    divisible_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if i % 3 == 0]
    sorted_divisible_by_three = sorted(divisible_by_three)
    result = []
    k = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3!= 0:
            result.append(x)
        else:
            result.append(sorted_divisible_by_three[k])
            k += 1
    return result
