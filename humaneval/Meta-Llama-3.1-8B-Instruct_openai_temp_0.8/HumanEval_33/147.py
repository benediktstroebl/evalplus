    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three,

    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list as per the problem statement.

This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` where the values at indices that are not divisible by three are the same as in `l`, while the values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted. The script also includes test cases to verify the function's correctness.
