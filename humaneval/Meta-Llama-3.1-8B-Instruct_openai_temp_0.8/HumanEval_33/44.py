This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'`. The new list is created by iterating over the original list, and for each index `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by 3. If it is, the value at that index in `l'` is set to the `i % 3`-th element of the sorted list of values at indices divisible by 3 in `l`. If `i` is not divisible by 3, the value at that index in `l'` is the same as in the original list `l`. The function uses list comprehension to efficiently create the new list.
