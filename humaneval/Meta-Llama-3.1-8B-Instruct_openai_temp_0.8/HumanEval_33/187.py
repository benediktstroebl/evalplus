This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` and returns a new list where the values at indices that are divisible by 3 are sorted. The function works by separating the list into two parts: one where the index is divisible by 3 and one where it's not. It then sorts the unsorted part and combines the sorted and unsorted parts while keeping the original order for the unsorted part. The function is tested with the provided examples.
