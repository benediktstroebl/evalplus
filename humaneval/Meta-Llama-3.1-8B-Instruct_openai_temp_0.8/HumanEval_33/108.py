```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])[j] for i, x in enumerate(l) for j in range(len([y for i, y in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])) if i % 3 == 0]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Expected output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

However, the given function has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to using list comprehensions inside a loop. We can optimize it to O(n) by using a different approach:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    sorted_divisible = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if i % 3!= 0:
            result.append(x)
        else:
            result.append(sorted_divisible[j])
            j += 1
        i += 1
    return result

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]
