This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` and returns a new list with values at indices divisible by 3 sorted. The function uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into three lists: one for indices divisible by 3, one for indices not divisible by 3, and one for values at indices divisible by 3. It then sorts the values at indices divisible by 3 and creates a new list where values at indices divisible by 3 are replaced with the sorted values. The function includes two test cases to demonstrate its usage.
