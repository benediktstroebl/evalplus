This script defines the `sort_third` function, which separates the input list into two parts: indices divisible by 3 and those not. It then sorts the values at indices divisible by 3, combines the two lists back together while keeping the original order for non-divisible by 3 values, and finally adds the sorted values for indices divisible by 3. The test cases at the end verify that the function works as expected.
