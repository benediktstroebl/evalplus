```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[j % len(x) if j < len(x) else j]
            for i, j, x in enumerate(zip(range(len(l)), range(len(l)), [l]))]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the original function can be difficult to read and understand. Let me suggest an improved version using `numpy` for better readability:

```python
import numpy as np

def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    indices = np.where(np.arange(len(l)) % 3 == 0)[0]
    sorted_values = np.sort([l[i] for i in indices])
    result = np.array(l)
    result[indices] = sorted_values
    return result.tolist()

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This improved version uses `numpy` to handle the indices and values that need to be sorted, making the code more concise and readable.
