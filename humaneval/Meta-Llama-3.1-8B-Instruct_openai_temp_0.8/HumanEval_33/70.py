    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three,

    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list according to the problem statement.

In this script, the function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and uses a list comprehension to create a new list `l'`. The list comprehension iterates over the indices `i` and values `x` in the input list `l`. If the index `i` is not divisible by three, it includes the value `x` in `l'`. If the index `i` is divisible by three, it includes the smallest value from the list that is divisible by three. This is achieved by using the `sorted` function to sort the list of values that are divisible by three and then selecting the first element from the sorted list.
