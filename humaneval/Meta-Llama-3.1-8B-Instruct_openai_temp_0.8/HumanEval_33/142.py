Here is a self-contained Python script that implements the `sort_third` function:

### sort_third function

#### Description
This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

#### Code
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l 
    in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies 
    that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies 
    of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): Input list

    Returns:
        list: List with values at indices divisible by 3 sorted
    """
    # Separate the list into three parts: elements not divisible by 3, 
    # elements divisible by 3, and the rest (which we ignore for now)
    not_divisible_by_3 = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    divisible_by_3 = sorted([x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])

    # Combine the three parts back together, using the sorted values at indices divisible by 3
    result = []
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(divisible_by_3[i // 3])
        else:
            result.append(x)

    return result

# Example use cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
    print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

#### Explanation
The `sort_third` function uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into three parts: elements not divisible by 3, elements divisible by 3, and the rest (which we ignore for now). It then sorts the elements divisible by 3 and combines the three parts back together, using the sorted values at indices divisible by 3. This results in a list that is identical to the input list at indices that are not divisible by 3, while the values at indices that are divisible by 3 are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of the input list, but sorted.
