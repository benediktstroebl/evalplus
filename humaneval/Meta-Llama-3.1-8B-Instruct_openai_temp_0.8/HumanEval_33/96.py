This script first separates the input list `l` into three lists: `l_not_divisible`, `l_divisible`, and `l_mod_three`, where `l_not_divisible` contains elements at indices not divisible by three, `l_divisible` contains elements at indices divisible by three, and `l_mod_three` is not used in this script (I left it as a placeholder for a potential future modification).

Then it sorts `l_divisible`.

Finally, it combines the lists, replacing the elements at the indices divisible by three with the sorted elements from `l_divisible`.
