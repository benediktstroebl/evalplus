```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range(len([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0]))]


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the previous function could have performance issues for large lists because it has to generate the entire list of values that are divisible by three first. A more efficient approach would be to simply sort the values that are divisible by three as we encounter them, like so:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    result = []
    sorted_divisible_by_three = []
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            sorted_divisible_by_three.append(x)
        result.append(x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted_divisible_by_three.pop(0))
    return result


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```
