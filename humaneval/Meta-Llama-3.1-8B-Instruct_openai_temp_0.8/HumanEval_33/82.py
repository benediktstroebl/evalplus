This script defines a function `sort_third(l)` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list with the same elements as `l`, but with the elements at indices that are divisible by three sorted in ascending order. The function uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into three parts: elements at indices not divisible by three, elements at indices divisible by three, and the rest. It then sorts the elements at indices divisible by three and combines the three parts back into a single list. The function includes two test cases to verify its correctness.
