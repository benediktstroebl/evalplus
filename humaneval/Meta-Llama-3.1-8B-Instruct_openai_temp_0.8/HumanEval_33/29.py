### Script to Sort Third Elements in a List

Here's a Python script that defines a function `sort_third` to achieve the given functionality:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): The input list

    Returns:
    list: The modified list
    """
    l_sorted = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]  # Get non-third elements in sorted order
    result = [None] * len(l)  # Initialize result list with None values

    # Populate result list
    for i, x in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3!= 0:
            result[i] = x  # Non-third elements remain unchanged
        else:
            result[i] = l_sorted.pop(0)  # Sort and assign third elements

    return result


# Example usage
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
# Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

In this script, the function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where elements at indices divisible by three are sorted. It achieves this by creating a sorted list of non-third elements and then iteratively populating the result list with the original non-third elements and the sorted third elements.
