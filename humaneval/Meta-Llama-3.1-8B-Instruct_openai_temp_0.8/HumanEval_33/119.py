    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three,

    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]

This script achieves the desired result by iterating over the list and checking if the index is divisible by 3. If it is, it sorts the values at the indices that are divisible by 3 and replaces the corresponding value in the list. If the index is not divisible by 3, it leaves the value unchanged.
