This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the elements at indices that are divisible by 3 are sorted. The original elements at indices not divisible by 3 are preserved in their original positions. The function uses list comprehension to separate the list into two parts, sorts the elements at indices divisible by 3, and then combines the two lists to produce the final result. The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
