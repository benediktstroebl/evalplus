```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The transformed list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] for i, x in enumerate(l) for k in range(i % 3)]


# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Expected: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a transformed list according to the problem description. It uses list comprehension with conditional statements to achieve the desired result. The test cases at the end verify the correctness of the function.
