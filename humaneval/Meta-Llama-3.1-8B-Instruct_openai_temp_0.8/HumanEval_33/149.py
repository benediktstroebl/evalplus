```python

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

This script defines a function `sort_third` that solves the problem. The function works by first separating the input list into two lists: one for elements at indices not divisible by 3, and one for elements at indices divisible by 3. It then combines the two lists, filling in the list at indices not divisible by 3 with the separate elements and the list at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted elements. The function returns the resulting list. The script includes two test cases to verify that the function works correctly.
