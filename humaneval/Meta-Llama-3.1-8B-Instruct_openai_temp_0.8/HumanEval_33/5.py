This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` and returns a new list with the values at indices divisible by three sorted. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the value of each element in the list. The list comprehension is used to create a new list where the values at indices divisible by three are replaced with the sorted values from the original list at those indices.
