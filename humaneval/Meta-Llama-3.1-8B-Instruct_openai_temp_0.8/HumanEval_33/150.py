```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal

    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] for k, (i, x) in enumerate(zip(range(len(l)), l))]

```

In this code, we use a list comprehension to create a new list where the values at indices not divisible by 3 are the same as the original list, and the values at indices divisible by 3 are sorted values from the original list. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the value of each item in the list, and the `zip` function is used to iterate over the indices and values together. The `sorted` function is used to sort the values at indices divisible by 3.
