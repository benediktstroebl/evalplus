This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list according to the specified rules. It first separates the list into two parts: elements at indices not divisible by three and those that are. It then sorts the list of elements at indices divisible by three. Finally, it combines the two lists while maintaining the original order of elements at indices not divisible by three. The function includes docstrings and test cases to ensure its correctness.
