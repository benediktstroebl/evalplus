This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list. It uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into two parts: one for indices not divisible by 3 and one for indices divisible by 3. It then sorts the values at the indices divisible by 3 using the `sort` method. Finally, it combines the two parts back into a list using another list comprehension. The script includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
