```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that
    `l'` is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three,
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list to be processed.

    Returns:
        list: The processed list.
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for j, y in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k] for k, (i, x) in enumerate(zip(range(len(l)), l))]

# Example usage:
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This Python function works by iterating over the input list `l` and for each index `i`:
- If `i` is not divisible by 3, it leaves the value at index `i` as is.
- If `i` is divisible by 3, it sorts the values at indices that are also divisible by 3 and assigns the `k`th value from this sorted list to the index `i` in the output list.

Note that this function assumes that the input list `l` is non-empty. If `l` can be empty, additional error handling may be necessary.
