This script first separates the input list `l` into two lists, `not_divisible_by_three` and `divisible_by_three`, based on whether their indices are divisible by three or not. It then sorts the `divisible_by_three` list. Finally, it combines the two lists, placing the sorted elements that are divisible by three in their correct positions, effectively sorting the original list at the indices that are divisible by three.
