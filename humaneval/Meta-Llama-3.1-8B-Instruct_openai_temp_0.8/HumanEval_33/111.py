This script uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices and values of the input list `l`. It checks if the index is divisible by 3. If it is not, it includes the original value. If it is, it creates a sorted list of all values at that index and selects the first element (since all elements at that index are the same). The result is the modified list with elements at indices divisible by 3 sorted.
