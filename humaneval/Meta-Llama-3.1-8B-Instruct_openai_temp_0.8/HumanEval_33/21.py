```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    result = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    for i, val in enumerate(l):  # Iterate over the list with indices and values
        if i % 3 == 0:  # Check if the index is divisible by 3
            result.append(sorted([val for j, v in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0]))  # Append the sorted values at indices divisible by 3
        else:
            result.append(val)  # Append the values at indices not divisible by 3
    return result

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, a more Pythonic way to solve this problem is to use list comprehension and slicing:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    return [val if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([v for j, v in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])[k % len([v for j, v in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0])] 
            for i, val in enumerate(l) for k in range(len([v for j, v in enumerate(l) if j % 3 == 0]))]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```
But a simple and most efficient way would be:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list
    """
    return [val if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([v for i, v in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0])[i % 3] for i, val in enumerate(l)]

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
