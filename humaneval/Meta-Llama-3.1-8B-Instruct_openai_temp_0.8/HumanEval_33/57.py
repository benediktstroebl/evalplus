This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list where the values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list with the sorted values, and another list comprehension to replace the original values with the sorted ones at the correct indices. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior.
