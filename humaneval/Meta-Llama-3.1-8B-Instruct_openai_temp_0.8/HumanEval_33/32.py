This script is a bit complex because it needs to check every element in the list to see if it's divisible by 3. However, it gets the job done. The main line of code is a list comprehension, where each element x in the list l is assigned a new value. If the index i is not divisible by 3, then x remains the same. If the index i is divisible by 3, then x is replaced by the k'th smallest element in l that is divisible by 3. The range of k is computed by counting the number of elements in l that are divisible by 3.
