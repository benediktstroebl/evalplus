```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.
    
    Parameters:
    l (list): The input list
    
    Returns:
    list: The modified list
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if y % 3 == 0])[0] if x % 3 == 0 else x for i, x in enumerate(l)]

# Test the function

print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This script defines a function `sort_third` that modifies the input list `l` according to the problem description. It then tests the function with the provided example inputs.
