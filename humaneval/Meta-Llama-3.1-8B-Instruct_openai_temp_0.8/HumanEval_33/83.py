This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a modified list. It first separates the list into two parts - one with indices not divisible by 3 and one with indices divisible by 3. It then sorts the list with indices divisible by 3. Finally, it combines the two lists, filling in the sorted divisible by three elements. The script also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function.
