This script defines the function `sort_third` and provides two test cases to demonstrate its usage. The function works by using list comprehension to separate the input list into two parts: elements at indices not divisible by 3, and elements at indices divisible by 3. The second part is then sorted before being concatenated with the first part. The result is a new list where elements at indices not divisible by 3 are the same as in the original list, and elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted.
