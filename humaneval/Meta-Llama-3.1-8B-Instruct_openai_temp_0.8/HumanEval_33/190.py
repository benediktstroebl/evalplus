This Python script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the elements at indices that are divisible by three are sorted. The function uses list comprehension to create the new list. It iterates over the input list and checks if the index is divisible by three. If it is, it includes the sorted elements at those indices in the new list. Otherwise, it includes the original element. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's usage and expected output.
