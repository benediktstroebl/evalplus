### Problem Solution: sort_third function

#### Description
This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
l' is identical to l at the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

#### Code
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with elements at indices divisible by three sorted.
    """
    # Use list comprehension to separate elements into two lists: one for indices divisible by three and one for other indices
    divisible_three = [element for i, element in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    not_divisible_three = [element for i, element in enumerate(l) if i % 3!= 0]
    
    # Sort the list for indices divisible by three
    divisible_three.sort()
    
    # Combine the two lists
    result = [0] * len(divisible_three)  # Initialize result list with zeros
    index = 0
    for i, element in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result[i] = divisible_three[index]
            index += 1
        else:
            result[i] = element
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

#### Explanation
This function works by first separating the input list into two lists: one for elements at indices divisible by three and one for elements at other indices. It then sorts the list for indices divisible by three. Finally, it combines the two lists, replacing elements at indices divisible by three with the sorted elements.
