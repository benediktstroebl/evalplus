```python

    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list according to the problem statement.

This script defines the `sort_third` function as specified, which returns a new list where elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted, while elements at other indices are left unchanged. The function uses list comprehension to create the new list. It then tests the function with the provided test cases.
