```python
def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list

    Returns:
        list: The modified list

This script defines the `sort_third` function, which iterates over the input list `l`. If the index `i` is not divisible by 3, the element at that index is included in the output list unchanged. If the index `i` is divisible by 3, the element at that index is replaced with a value from the list of elements at indices divisible by 3, which is sorted before being included in the output list. The original index `i` and the element `x` at that index are used to determine which element from the sorted list to include at index `i` in the output list. The output list is then returned by the function.
