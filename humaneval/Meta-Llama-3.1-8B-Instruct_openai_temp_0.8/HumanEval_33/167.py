### Python Script to Sort Third

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, 
    while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal 
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
        l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list.
    """
    # Separate the list into two parts: one where the index is divisible by 3 and one where it's not
    not_divisible_by_3 = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3!= 0]
    divisible_by_3 = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]

    # Sort the part of the list where the index is divisible by 3
    divisible_by_3.sort()

    # Combine the two parts back into the original list
    result = []
    not_divisible_by_3_index = 0
    divisible_by_3_index = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(divisible_by_3[divisible_by_3_index])
            divisible_by_3_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(not_divisible_by_3[not_divisible_by_3_index])
            not_divisible_by_3_index += 1

    return result

# Test cases
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Expected output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This script defines a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where the elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted, but the elements at other indices remain unchanged. The function uses list comprehensions to separate the input list into two parts and then sorts the part where the index is divisible by 3. Finally, it combines the two parts back into the original list using a for loop. The test cases demonstrate the function's correctness.
