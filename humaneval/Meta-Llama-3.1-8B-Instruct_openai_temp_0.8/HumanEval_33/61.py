```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list.

    Example:
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted([y for y in l if i % 3 == 0])[j] 
            for i, x in enumerate(l) for j, y in enumerate(l)]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

However, the code has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested for loops. We can improve it to O(n) as follows:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list.

    Example:
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    div_by_three = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    return [x if i % 3!= 0 else sorted(div_by_three)[j] for i, x in enumerate(l) for j in range(len(div_by_three))]

# Test the function
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

This version of the function works by first creating a list `div_by_three` of all the elements from the original list `l` that are at indices divisible by 3. It then uses a list comprehension to create the output list `l'`, where elements at indices divisible by 3 are taken from `sorted(div_by_three)`. This way, the time complexity is reduced to O(n).
