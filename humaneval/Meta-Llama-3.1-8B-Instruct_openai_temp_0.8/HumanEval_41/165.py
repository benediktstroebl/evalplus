### Car Collision Problem Solution
#### Problem Description
This Python script calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario with `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left.

#### Code

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars moving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, each collision results in two cars continuing to move
    # The number of possible collisions for each car is n - 1 (excluding itself)
    # Therefore, the total number of collisions for all cars is n * (n - 1)
    # However, each collision is counted twice (once for each car involved), so we divide by 2
    return (n * (n - 1)) // 2

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(f"Number of collisions for {n} cars: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

#### Explanation
This script uses the formula for the number of possible collisions in a set of `n` points (or cars) in a line, which is `(n * (n - 1)) // 2`. This formula is based on the concept of combinations in combinatorial mathematics. Since each collision involves two cars and each collision is counted twice (once for each car), we divide by 2 to get the actual number of collisions.
