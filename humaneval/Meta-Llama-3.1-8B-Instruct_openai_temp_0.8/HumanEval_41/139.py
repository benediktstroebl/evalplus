**Solving the Car Collision Problem**
=====================================

Below is a self-contained Python script that solves the problem of calculating the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between cars moving left to right and right to left.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    
    # Initialize the number of collisions to 0
    collisions = 0
    
    # Calculate the number of collisions using the formula n*(n-1)//2
    # This formula represents the number of combinations of n items taken 2 at a time
    collisions = n * (n - 1) // 2
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
n = 5  # Number of cars in each direction
print(f"The number of collisions when there are {n} cars in each direction is: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

**Explanation**
---------------

The problem can be solved using combinatorics. Since each pair of cars from the two sets will collide exactly once, we can calculate the total number of collisions by counting the number of pairs of cars from the two sets. This can be done using the formula for combinations: n*(n-1)//2, where n is the number of cars in each set.

In the provided code, we use this formula to calculate the number of collisions, which is then returned by the function. The example usage at the end shows how to call the function with a specific value of n and print the result.
