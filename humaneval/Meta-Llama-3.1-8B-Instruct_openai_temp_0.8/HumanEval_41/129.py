### Car Race Collision Problem
#### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. `n` cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of `n` cars are driving right to left.  The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

#### Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the total number of collisions to 0
    total_collisions = 0

    # Loop over the number of cars in each direction
    for i in range(n):
        # Since the cars are sturdy and strong, every collision creates a new collision
        # So the number of collisions is the sum of the first n positive integers
        # We use the formula n*(n-1)/2 to calculate the sum
        total_collisions += i + 1

    # Return the total number of collisions
    return total_collisions

# Example usage:
n = 3
print(f"The number of collisions in a car race with {n} cars in each direction is: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

This solution uses a simple loop to calculate the total number of collisions. The number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first `n` positive integers, which is calculated using the formula `n*(n-1)/2`. This is because every collision creates a new collision, and the number of collisions is proportional to the number of pairs of cars that can collide.
