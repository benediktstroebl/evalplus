    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race where n cars are driving in each direction.
    
    The function uses the concept of array prefix sums to efficiently calculate the number of collisions.

    n (int): The number of cars driving in each direction.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions in the car race.

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions in a car race where `n` cars are driving in each direction. The function uses two lists to store the positions of the cars moving left to right and right to left, and then iterates over the positions to calculate the number of collisions. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n).
