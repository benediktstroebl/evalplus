This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions between two sets of `n` cars moving in opposite directions. The function uses a simple formula to count the number of collisions, which is derived from the fact that each pair of cars contributes to the same number of collisions, and each collision is counted twice if we simply multiply the number of pairs by the number of collisions per pair. The script includes an example usage at the end.
