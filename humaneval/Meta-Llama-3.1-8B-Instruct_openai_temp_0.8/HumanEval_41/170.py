### Car Collision Counter
#### Problem Description
Imagine a straight, infinitely long road. We have two sets of `n` cars, one set driving left to right, and the other set driving right to left. They move at the same speed. A collision occurs when a left-bound car hits a right-bound car. The cars are indestructible, so they keep moving as if they collided.

#### Solution

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Counts the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Calculate the total number of cars
    total_cars = 2 * n
    
    # The number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first n natural numbers
    # This is because each left-bound car collides with every right-bound car that is ahead of it
    # We use the formula n * (n + 1) // 2 to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers
    collisions = n * (n + 1) // 2
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
n = 5  # Number of cars in each set
print(f"With {n} cars in each set, there are {car_race_collision(n)} collisions.")
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the total number of collisions between two sets of `n` cars. The solution is based on the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which represents the number of collisions between the left-bound and right-bound cars. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a specific value for `n`.
