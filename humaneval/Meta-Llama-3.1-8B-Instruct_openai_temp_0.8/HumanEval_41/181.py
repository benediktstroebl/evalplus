### Car Collision Problem
#### Self-Contained Python Script
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: Number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the total number of collisions
    total_collisions = 0

    # Loop through each pair of cars
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            # If the cars do not collide, decrement their positions by 1
            if i + j >= n - 1:
                # The cars collide, increment the total number of collisions
                total_collisions += 1

    # There are n sets of n-1 collisions
    return total_collisions


# Test the function
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Example usage
```
This script uses a brute-force approach to calculate the number of collisions by iterating over each pair of cars and checking if they collide. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of cars in each set.
