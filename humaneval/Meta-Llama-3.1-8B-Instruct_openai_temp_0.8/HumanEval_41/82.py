### Car Race Collision Problem Solution
```markdown
### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.
```

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    return math.comb(n, 2)

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
```

In this solution, we use the `math.comb(n, 2)` function, which calculates the number of combinations of n items taken 2 at a time. This directly gives us the number of pairs of cars that can collide, which is equivalent to the number of collisions.
