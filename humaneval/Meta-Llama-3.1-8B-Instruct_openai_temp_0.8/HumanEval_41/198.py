```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving in opposite directions.
    
    The cars move at the same speed and are infinitely sturdy, allowing them to pass through each other.
    
    This problem can be solved using combinatorics. The total number of possible'meetings' is the number of ways to choose two cars from the total, which is (2n choose 2).
    
    However, since the cars can pass through each other, only the initial'meeting' of two cars matters. Therefore, the number of collisions is simply the total number of possible'meetings' minus the number of cars that don't meet (i.e., cars that meet after other cars have passed through them).
    
    This is equivalent to the number of possible'meetings' minus the number of combinations of n-1 cars taken 2 at a time.
    
    :param n: The number of cars
    :return: The number of collisions
    """
    import math
    total_meetings = math.comb(2*n, 2)
    other_cars_collisions = math.comb(n-1, 2)
    
    return total_meetings - other_cars_collisions

# Test the function
print(car_race_collision(5))
```

This script uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the number of combinations, which is a efficient way to calculate binomial coefficients. It then returns the total number of collisions by subtracting the number of combinations of the other cars taken 2 at a time from the total number of possible meetings.
