    This function calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars,
    one moving left to right and the other moving right to left, on an infinitely
    long straight road.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as we are using a brute force
    approach to check collisions between all pairs of cars.

This script uses a brute-force approach to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars. It iterates over all pairs of left-moving and right-moving cars and checks if they collide by comparing their positions at any given time. If a collision is detected, the number of collisions is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total number of collisions. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of cars in each set.
