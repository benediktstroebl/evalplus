### Car Collision Simulator
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the total number of collisions
    total_collisions = 0

    # Loop through each pair of cars
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # The first car will collide with all cars on the other side
        total_collisions += n - i

    # Since each collision is counted twice (once for each car), divide by 2
    total_collisions //= 2

    return total_collisions


# Example usage:
n = 4
print(f"Number of collisions for {n} cars in each set: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```
In this script, we iterate through each pair of cars, and for each pair, we count the number of cars that can collide with it. Since each collision is counted twice (once for each car), we divide the total count by 2 to get the final result.
