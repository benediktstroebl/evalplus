### Car Collision Problem Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between left-to-right and right-to-left moving cars.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # All cars move at the same speed, so we can use a stationary point as the reference
    # Each left-to-right car will collide with every right-to-left car in front of it
    # So, the number of collisions for a single left-to-right car is equal to its position
    # The number of left-to-right cars is 'n', and the number of right-to-left cars is also 'n'
    # The total number of collisions will be the sum of the first 'n' positive integers

    # Calculate the sum of the first 'n' positive integers using the formula: n * (n + 1) / 2
    total_collisions = n * (n + 1) // 2

    return total_collisions

# Example usage
n = 5
result = car_race_collision(n)
print(f"The number of collisions in a car race with {n} cars in each set is: {result}")
```
This script uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` positive integers to efficiently calculate the number of collisions. The time complexity is O(1), making it suitable for large inputs.
