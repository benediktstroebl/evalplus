```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):

    This function calculates the number of car collisions in a straight road
    where n cars are moving left to right and n cars are moving right to left.

    The function uses the concept of stars and bars to find the total number of
    possible combinations where 2 cars from the two sets of n cars collide.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars moving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of car collisions.

This script defines a function `car_race_collision(n)` that takes the number of cars `n` as input and returns the total number of car collisions. The function uses the concept of stars and bars to calculate the total number of possible combinations where 2 cars from the two sets of `n` cars collide. The result is then divided by 2 to avoid double counting. The script also includes an example usage of the function.
