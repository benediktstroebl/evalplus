This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving in opposite directions. It uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the binomial coefficient, which in this case represents the maximum number of collisions. The function returns the total number of collisions, which is then printed out in an example usage section.
