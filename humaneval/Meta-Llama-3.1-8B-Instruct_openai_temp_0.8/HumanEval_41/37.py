### Collision Detection in a Car Race
#### Problem Statement
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

#### Solution

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions in the car race.
    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first n positive integers
    # This is because each car that is moving left to right can potentially collide with all cars that are moving right to left
    # The formula for the sum of the first n positive integers is n*(n+1)/2
    if n <= 0:
        return 0  # No collisions if there are no or negative cars
    else:
        return n * (n + 1) // 2


# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(3))  # Output: 6
```

In this solution, we're using the mathematical formula to calculate the sum of the first n positive integers. This corresponds to the number of potential collisions, as each of the n cars moving left to right can collide with all of the n cars moving right to left. The `//` operator is used for integer division, ensuring that the result is an integer.
