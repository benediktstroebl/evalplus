### Car Collision Detection
#### Problem Solution

Here is a Python function that solves the problem. We use a simple and efficient approach to calculate the number of collisions.

```markdown
## car_race_collision.py
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize a variable to store the total number of collisions
    total_collisions = 0

    # Calculate the total number of pairs of cars that can collide
    # This is a combination of n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2

    # The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars
    # This is because each pair of cars can potentially collide
    total_collisions = total_pairs

    return total_collisions
```

#### Example Usage

```python
# Test the function with a sample input
n = 5
collisions = car_race_collision(n)
print(f"For {n} cars, the total number of collisions is: {collisions}")
```

This script uses a simple mathematical approach to calculate the total number of collisions in the car race scenario. The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars, which is a combination of n choose 2, or n*(n-1)/2. This is because each pair of cars can potentially collide.
