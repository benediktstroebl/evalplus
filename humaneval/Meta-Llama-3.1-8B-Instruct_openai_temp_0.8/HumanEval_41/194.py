### Car Collision Problem Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of collisions between cars driving left to right and cars driving right to left.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    def collisions_after_moving(num_cars, moves):
        """
        Calculate the number of collisions after a certain number of moves.

        Args:
            num_cars (int): The number of cars.
            moves (int): The number of moves each car has made.

        Returns:
            int: The total number of collisions.
        """
        total_collisions = 0

```

### Example Usage
```python
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Example usage
```

This script calculates the total number of collisions between cars driving left to right and cars driving right to left. The `car_race_collision` function uses a helper function `collisions_after_moving` to calculate the number of collisions after a certain number of moves. The total number of collisions is then calculated by summing the collisions after each number of moves, and the result is divided by 2 to avoid counting each collision twice.
