    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    # The number of collisions can be calculated using combinatorics. 
    # Since each car moving left to right will collide with all the cars moving right to left,
    # the number of collisions is given by the binomial coefficient n choose 2.

    # The binomial coefficient n choose k (nCk) can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)
    # where n! denotes the factorial of n.
    
    # Importing the math module to use the factorial function.

    # Calculate the number of collisions using the formula for binomial coefficient.

```
This script defines the `car_race_collision` function and uses the `math.comb` function from Python's standard library to calculate the number of collisions in the car race scenario. The `math.comb` function returns the binomial coefficient n choose k, which is equal to the number of collisions in this problem.
