```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Calculate the total number of cars
    total_cars = n * 2
    
    # The number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first n-1 positive integers
    # because each collision involves a car from the first set and a car from the second set,
    # and the number of collisions increases by 1 as the cars move closer to each other.
    # This is equivalent to the formula n*(n-1)/2.
    collisions = n * (n - 1)
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))
```

This script calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on a straight line. It does this by calculating the total number of cars, then using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to determine the number of collisions. The result is then printed to the console.
