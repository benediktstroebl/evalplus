In this script, we define a helper function `calculate_pairs` to calculate the number of pairs for `n` items. This is done by summing up the number of items that can pair with each item, which is `n - i - 1` for the `i-th` item. We then call this function twice, once for each set of cars, and multiply the results by 2 to get the total number of collisions.

Note that this solution uses the formula for combinations, specifically `n * (n - 1) / 2`, to calculate the number of pairs. This formula is derived from the fact that each item can pair with every other item except itself and other items that are beyond its matching threshold.
