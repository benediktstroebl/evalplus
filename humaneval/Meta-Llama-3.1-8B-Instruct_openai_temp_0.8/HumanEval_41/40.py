### Car Race Collision Problem Solution
#### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. `n` cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of `n` cars are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.

#### Solution
```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of car collisions in a simultaneous car race.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The number of car collisions.

    """
    # Calculate the number of collisions using the formula for sum of first 'n' positive integers
    # 1 + 2 + 3 +... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2
    # Since there's a collision after every number of cars, the formula gives us the total collisions
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 15
```
This code uses the mathematical concept of the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the number of collisions. The formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` gives us the total number of collisions, which is then returned by the function. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which returns the integer part of the result. The `car_race_collision(5)` call demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the number of collisions for `n = 5`.
