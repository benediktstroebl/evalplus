```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the total collisions to 0
    total_collisions = 0
    
    # The number of pairs of cars that can collide is given by the formula n*(n-1)
    # This is because for each car moving left to right, there are (n-1) cars moving right to left
    # that it can collide with
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1)
    
    # Return the total number of collisions
    return total_pairs

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 20
```

However, this is a simplification, as the actual solution is not as straightforward. The correct solution is based on the concept of combinations.

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Use the combination formula to calculate the number of pairs of cars that can collide
    # This is equivalent to the number of ways to choose two cars out of n
    total_pairs = math.comb(2*n, 2)
    
    # Return the total number of collisions
    return total_pairs

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 45
