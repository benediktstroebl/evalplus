This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario. It uses the mathematical formula for combinations to calculate the number of positions where collisions can occur, which is simply the number of positions (or cars) in each direction. The function is then tested with different inputs. 

However, note that this simplification is accurate for this particular scenario, where two cars only collide if they are at the same position.
