This script defines a function `car_race_collision(n)` that calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario with `n` cars moving in each direction. It uses the math module's `comb` function to calculate the combinations, which corresponds to the number of ways to choose pairs of cars from the two sets. The result is then printed out when the function is called with `n=5`.
