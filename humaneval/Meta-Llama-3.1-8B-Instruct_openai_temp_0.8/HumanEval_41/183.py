### Car Collision Problem Solution

#### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. `n` cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of `n` cars are driving right to left. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left, but they continue moving after a collision.

#### Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of collisions between left-moving and right-moving cars.

    :param n: Number of cars moving left and right.
    :return: Number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize two lists to store the positions of cars moving left and right
    left_cars = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    right_cars = [n - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]

    # Sort the positions of the cars
    left_cars.sort()
    right_cars.sort(reverse=True)

    # Initialize a variable to store the number of collisions
    collisions = 0

    # Iterate over the positions of the cars and count collisions
    i = j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if left_cars[i] >= right_cars[j]:
            collisions += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1

    return collisions
```

#### Example Usage
```python
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 3
print(car_race_collision(10))  # Output: 9
```
This solution first initializes two lists to store the positions of cars moving left and right. It then sorts the positions of the cars and iterates over them, counting the number of collisions. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n).
