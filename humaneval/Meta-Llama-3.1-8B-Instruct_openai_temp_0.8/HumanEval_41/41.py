### Car Collision Problem Solution

The problem can be solved by using a sweep line approach, where we simulate the movement of both sets of cars by their positions. This way, we can efficiently detect collisions.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars moving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the events
    events = []

    # Generate events for cars moving left to right
    for i in range(n):
        # Event 1: car starts moving (prevents collisions with same car)
        events.append((i, -i))
        # Event 2: car crosses the origin (potential collision point)
        events.append((i, i))

    # Generate events for cars moving right to left
    for i in range(n):
        # Event 1: car starts moving (prevents collisions with same car)
        events.append((n + i, -i - n))
        # Event 2: car crosses the origin (potential collision point)
        events.append((n + i, i + n))

    # Sort the events based on their positions
    events.sort()

    # Initialize a counter to store the number of collisions
    collision_count = 0

    # Initialize a set to store the positions of cars that have crossed the origin
    crossed_cars = set()

    # Process the events
    for event in events:
        # If the car is crossing the origin
        if event[1] > 0:
            # Add the car's position to the set
            crossed_cars.add(event[1])
        # If the car is starting to move and has crossed the origin before
        elif event[1] < 0 and -event[1] in crossed_cars:
            # Increment the collision count
            collision_count += 1

    return collision_count
```

### Example Usage

```python
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
```

This script simulates the car race scenario by generating events for each car's movement. It then sorts the events and processes them to detect collisions. The number of collisions is counted and returned by the function. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a specific input value.
