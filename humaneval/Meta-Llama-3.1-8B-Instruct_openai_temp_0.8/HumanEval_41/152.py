### Car Collision Problem Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.

    """
    # The number of collisions is the sum of the first n natural numbers
    # This is because for each car driving left to right, it can collide with all cars driving right to left that are ahead of it
    # Similarly, each car driving right to left can collide with all cars driving left to right that are ahead of it
    # This creates a total of n + (n-1) + (n-2) +... + 1 = n*(n+1)//2 collisions
    return n * (n + 1) // 2


# Example usage
n = 5
print(f"The number of collisions when n = {n} is: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```
This script uses the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n*(n+1)//2. This formula is derived from the fact that for each car driving left to right, it can collide with all cars driving right to left that are ahead of it. Similarly, each car driving right to left can collide with all cars driving left to right that are ahead of it. The total number of collisions is the sum of these individual collisions.
