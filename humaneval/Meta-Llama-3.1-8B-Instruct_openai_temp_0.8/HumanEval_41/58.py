    Calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions.

    # Each car has a unique pair in the other direction
    # The number of pairs is n (for each left-to-right car, there's a right-to-left car)
    # But, since cars preserve their trajectory, for each pair, we have n - 1 additional collisions
    # This is because each time the left-to-right car passes a right-to-left car that's not its pair, a collision occurs
    # We multiply this by 2 because these same n - 1 collisions happen for the right-to-left car too
    # However, each collision is counted twice (once for each car), so we divide by 2
    # Finally, we multiply by n to account for all pairs of cars

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 40

This script calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions. The core idea is that each left-to-right car will collide with every right-to-left car that it passes, resulting in a total of n * (n - 1) collisions per pair of cars. Since there are n pairs of cars, we multiply this by n, and then we divide by 2 to account for the fact that each collision is counted twice.
