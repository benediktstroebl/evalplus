```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of car collisions in a car race.
    
    The idea is that when two cars collide, they will not stop each other, but 
    will continue to move in their original direction. This is equivalent to 
    a single car moving with a speed twice as large as the original speed. 
    Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of "cars" that 
    will be left after all cars have moved, which is the greatest common divisor 
    of the number of left-to-right and right-to-left cars with all numbers from 1 
    to the number of cars.
    
    Args:
    n: The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    An integer representing the number of car collisions.

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars driving left to right and right to left. The function uses the concept of greatest common divisor (GCD) to calculate the number of collisions, as explained in the provided problem description. The GCD is used to find the number of "cars" that will be left after all cars have moved. The function then returns the number of collisions, which is `n` minus the number of "cars" left.

The example usage at the end shows how to call the function with different inputs and print the results.
