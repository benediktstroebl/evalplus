This script works by simulating the car race scenario. It maintains two lists, `left_cars` and `right_cars`, which store the number of cars left to right and right to left, respectively. It then compares each car in the left set with each car in the right set to determine if they collide. If two cars collide, it increments the `collisions` count. Finally, it returns the total number of collisions.
