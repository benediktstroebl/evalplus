    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving in opposite directions.

    # The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide
    # When you're generating pairs from a set with n elements, there are n*(n-1)/2 possible pairs
    # This formula is derived from the combination formula. For n elements, there are n*(n-1)/2 pairs
    # For example, with 3 elements, the pairs are: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). There are 3*2 / 2 = 3 pairs

n = 5

This Python script calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars driving in opposite directions. The number of collisions is determined by the number of pairs of cars that can collide, which is given by the formula `n * (n - 1) / 2`. This script takes the number of cars `n` as input and returns the number of collisions.
