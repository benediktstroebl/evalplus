### Car Race Collision Problem Solution
#### Problem Description
The problem describes a scenario where `n` cars are driving left to right, and another set of `n` cars are driving right to left on an infinitely long straight road. The cars move at the same speed and are considered to collide when a left-to-right car hits a right-to-left car. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, they continue moving as if they didn't collide.

#### Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving in opposite directions.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # The number of pairs of cars that can collide is equal to the number of cars driving left to right
    # because each car in the left-to-right group will collide with one car in the right-to-left group
    return n

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 5
print(car_race_collision(10))  # Output: 10
```

In this solution, we take advantage of the fact that each car in the left-to-right group will collide with one car in the right-to-left group. Therefore, the total number of collisions is simply equal to the number of cars driving left to right, which is `n`.
