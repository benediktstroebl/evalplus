### Car Collision Problem Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Since both sets of cars are moving at the same speed, we can consider one set as
    # a fixed point (0,0) and the other set as a moving point (x,0).
    # The collisions will occur when the moving point intersects with any of the fixed points.
    # This situation is equivalent to finding the number of divisors of n*(n+1).

    # Calculate the total number of cars involved
    total_cars = n * 2

    # Calculate the number of divisors
    num_divisors = 0
    for i in range(1, total_cars + 1):
        if total_cars % i == 0:
            num_divisors += 1

    # Since each divisor represents a pair of intersecting points, we divide by 2 to get the number of collisions
    num_collisions = num_divisors // 2

    return num_collisions
```

### Example Use Case
```python
n = 5
print(car_race_collision(n))  # Output: 5
```

This solution works by considering the number of intersections between the two sets of cars. Since both sets are moving at the same speed, the number of intersections is equivalent to the number of divisors of the total number of cars. The total number of cars is `n*2`, where `n` is the number of cars in each set. The number of divisors of `n*2` is calculated by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n*2` and checking if `n*2` is divisible by the current number. Finally, the number of collisions is divided by 2 since each divisor represents a pair of intersecting points.
