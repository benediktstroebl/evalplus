## Car Race Collision Problem

This script calculates the number of collisions between two sets of `n` cars,
one driving left to right and the other driving right to left on an infinitely
long straight road.

### Code

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions between two sets of `n` cars.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # The total number of cars is 2n
    total_cars = 2 * n
    
    # The number of collisions is equal to the total number of cars choose 2
    # This can be calculated using the formula n*(n-1)/2
    import math
    collisions = math.comb(total_cars, 2)
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
n = 5  # number of cars in each set
print(f"The number of collisions between 2 sets of {n} cars is: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

### Explanation

The number of collisions can be calculated by considering all pairs of cars.
Each car can potentially collide with every other car, resulting in a total
of 2n * (2n - 1) / 2 pairs. However, this counts each collision twice (once
for each car involved), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number
of collisions. This is equivalent to calculating the binomial coefficient
(total_cars choose 2).
