```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario 
    where n cars are driving left to right and n cars are driving right to left.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right or right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions in the car race scenario.
    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first n odd integers.
    # This is because we can pair up the cars such that the first car from the left
    # collides with the first car from the right, the second car from the left
    # collides with the second car from the right, and so on.
    # The jth car from the left and the jth car from the right collide at a distance
    # of 2j, so the number of collisions is the sum of the first n odd integers.
    # The sum of the first k odd integers is k^2.
    return n ** 2

# Test the function
print(car_race_collision(3))  # Output: 9
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 25
print(car_race_collision(10))  # Output: 100
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions in the car race scenario. The function uses the mathematical fact that the sum of the first `k` odd integers is `k^2`. The script then tests the function with different values of `n`.
