### Car Collision Problem Solver
#### Problem Description
The following Python script calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario where two sets of `n` cars, moving in opposite directions, collide but continue moving without any disruption.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.

    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the total number of pairs of cars.
    # Since each pair of cars will collide once, we can simply return the number of pairs.
    # The number of pairs is calculated using the formula for combinations:
    # nC2 = n * (n - 1) / 2
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_cars = 5
    collisions = car_race_collision(num_cars)
    print(f"Number of collisions for {num_cars} cars: {collisions}")
```

In this script, we use the mathematical concept of combinations to calculate the number of pairs of cars that will collide. The number of pairs is then returned as the result. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a specific number of cars and print the result.
