### Car Race Collision Problem
#### Solution in Python

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race with two sets of n cars.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs that can be formed
    # from n cars. This is given by the combination formula C(n, 2)
    from math import comb
    return comb(n * 2, 2)


# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 20
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions in a car race with two sets of cars. The number of collisions is determined by the number of pairs that can be formed from the total number of cars (n * 2), which is calculated using the combination formula C(n, 2). The result is returned as an integer.
