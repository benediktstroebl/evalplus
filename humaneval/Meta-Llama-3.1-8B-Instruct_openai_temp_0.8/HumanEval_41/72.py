### Car Race Collision Problem
#### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
`n` cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of `n` cars
are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.

#### Solution
```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving in opposite directions.

    :param n: The number of cars in each set.
    :return: The number of collisions.
    """
    # The cars are moving in the same speed, so the distance between each pair of cars is the same.
    # We can calculate the distance between each pair of cars by considering the positions of the cars.
    # The positions of the cars can be thought of as a sequence of numbers from 1 to n and from n to 1 respectively.
    # We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of the distances between each pair of cars.
    # The sum of the distances between each pair of cars is equal to the number of pairs times the distance between each pair.
    # The number of pairs is equal to the number of cars times the number of cars minus the number of cars.
    # So, the sum of the distances between each pair of cars is equal to the number of cars times the number of cars minus the number of cars.
    # The distance between each pair of cars is equal to the number of cars.
    # Therefore, the sum of the distances between each pair of cars is equal to the number of cars times the number of cars minus the number of cars times the number of cars.
    # Simplifying the expression, we get the sum of the distances between each pair of cars is equal to the number of cars times the number of cars minus the number of cars squared.
    # However, this is the total distance that all pairs of cars must cover to collide.
    # Since all cars move at the same speed, the time it takes for all pairs of cars to collide is equal to the total distance divided by the speed.
    # The speed is not given, but we know that all cars move at the same speed, so the speed is the distance between each pair of cars divided by the time it takes for each pair of cars to collide.
    # Therefore, the speed is the distance between each pair of cars divided by the number of cars minus 1.
    # Since all cars move at the same speed, the time it takes for each pair of cars to collide is equal to the number of cars minus 1.
    # Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars times the number of cars minus the number of cars squared divided by the number of cars minus 1.
    # Simplifying the expression, we get the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars.
    return n

>>> car_race_collision(5)
5
>>> car_race_collision(10)
10
```
The solution assumes that the cars are moving at the same speed. If the speeds are different, the problem becomes more complex and requires more advanced mathematics to solve.
