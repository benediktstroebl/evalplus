This script uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It generates two lists of numbers representing the positions of the left-to-right and right-to-left cars, and then iteratively checks for collisions between the cars. The total number of collisions is incremented whenever a collision is found, and the collided cars are removed from their respective lists to avoid counting the same collision multiple times. The script finally returns the total number of collisions.
