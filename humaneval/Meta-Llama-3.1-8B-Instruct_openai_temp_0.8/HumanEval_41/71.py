### Car Race Collision Problem Solution

### Problem: Car Race Collision
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

### Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a scenario where n cars are driving left to right and n cars are driving right to left.

    The idea is to represent each pair of cars as a point on a 2D plane, where the x-coordinate is the position of the car driving left to right, and the y-coordinate is the position of the car driving right to left. The number of collisions is then equal to the number of points on or below the line y = x, which is equivalent to the number of pairs of points that satisfy the condition (x1-x2) * (x1 + x2) <= 0.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions.

    """
    # Initialize the collision counter
    collisions = 0
    
    # Iterate over each pair of cars
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # The i-th car driving left to right has position i
        # The i-th car driving right to left has position 1 - i
        # Check if the pair satisfies the collision condition
        if (i - (1 - i)) * (i + (1 - i)) <= 0:
            # If the pair satisfies the collision condition, increment the collision counter
            collisions += 1
    
    # Return the total number of collisions
    return collisions

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(10))
```
This script calculates the number of collisions in the specified scenario by iterating over each pair of cars and checking if they satisfy the collision condition. The result is the total number of collisions.
