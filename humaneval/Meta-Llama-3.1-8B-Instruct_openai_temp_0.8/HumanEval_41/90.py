This Python script defines a function `car_race_collision` to calculate the total number of collisions in a car race scenario, where `n` cars are driving left to right and another `n` cars are driving right to left. The function uses the mathematical formula for triangular numbers (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) to efficiently calculate the total collisions, as each pair of cars results in a single collision. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a specific input value of `n`.
