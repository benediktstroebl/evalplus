### Car Collision Problem Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars
    driving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
    """
    # The number of pairs of cars is the number of possible positions for the first car
    # multiplied by the number of possible positions for the second car
    # which is n*(n-1) per set. However, each pair is counted twice (once for each car)
    # so we need to divide by 2.
    return n * (n - 1) // 2 * 2

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 40
```
This solution uses a simple mathematical formula to calculate the number of collisions. The number of pairs of cars is the number of possible positions for the first car multiplied by the number of possible positions for the second car, divided by 2 to avoid double counting. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions.
