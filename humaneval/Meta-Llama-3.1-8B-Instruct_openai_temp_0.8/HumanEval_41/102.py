### Car Collision Function
#### Problem: Car Race Collision

The following Python script calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions.
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first n-1 positive integers
    # This is because each car collides with every car to its left (except itself)
    return (n * (n - 1)) // 2

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
```
This function uses the formula for the sum of the first n-1 positive integers, which is n*(n-1)/2. This formula represents the number of collisions because each car collides with every car to its left (except itself), and there are n cars in each set.
