**Car Collision Problem Solution**
=====================================

The problem can be solved using the concept of combinatorics and a little bit of mathematical reasoning.

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Returns the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    :param n: The number of cars driving left to right and right to left
    :return: The number of collisions
    """
    # The total number of collisions is the sum of the number of pairs of cars
    # from the two sets of n cars. This is equal to n * (n - 1) / 2 for each set,
    # and we multiply it by 2 because there are two sets of cars.
    total_collisions = 2 * math.comb(n, 2)

    return total_collisions

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(f"Number of collisions with {n} cars: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

**Explanation**
---------------

The code uses the `math.comb(n, k)` function to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. In this case, we want to calculate the number of pairs of cars from the two sets of n cars.

Since the cars are driving in opposite directions, each pair of cars will result in exactly one collision, regardless of the order in which they collide. Therefore, we can simply multiply the number of pairs of cars from each set by 2 to get the total number of collisions.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), making it efficient for large inputs.
