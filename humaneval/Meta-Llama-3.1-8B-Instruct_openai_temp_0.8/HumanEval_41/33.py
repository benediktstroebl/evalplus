**Collision Calculation Script**
================================

This Python script calculates the number of car collisions in a race scenario.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # The formula to calculate the number of collisions is (n choose 2)
    # Which is n*(n-1)//2.
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5  # Change this value to test different scenarios
    collision_count = car_race_collision(n)
    print(f"Number of collisions when n = {n}: {collision_count}")
```

**Explanation**
---------------

This function uses the formula for combinations (n choose 2) to calculate the number of collisions. This formula is `n*(n-1)//2`, which is equivalent to `n choose 2`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which returns the quotient without the remainder.

**Note**: This script assumes that the cars are driving in two distinct groups, one moving left to right and the other moving right to left. The function does not simulate the collision process, but rather calculates the expected number of collisions based on the number of cars in each group.
