### Car Race Collision Problem

Here is a Python script that uses a hash table to keep track of the cars traveling in each direction and counts the collisions.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize a hash table to store the rightmost position of left-moving cars
    right-moving_cars = {}
    
    # Initialize a variable to store the number of collisions
    collisions = 0
    
    # Loop over each car moving right
    for right in range(1, n + 1):
        # Find the leftmost position of cars that could potentially collide with the current car
        left = right + n - 1
        # If there is a car moving left to the right that is to the left of the current right-moving car,
        # increment the collision count and update the rightmost position of the left-moving car
        if left - 1 in right-moving_cars:
            collisions += 1
            del right-moving_cars[left - 1]
        # Add the current right-moving car to the hash table
        right-moving_cars[right] = right
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))
```

This script simulates the car race scenario by iterating over the cars moving right and checking for potential collisions with cars moving left. It uses a hash table to store the rightmost position of left-moving cars, which allows for efficient lookups and updates. The number of collisions is incrementally tracked and returned as the result.
