This script uses a brute force approach to find all collisions between the two sets of cars. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of cars in each set. This is because we iterate over all pairs of cars.

However, this approach has a lot of redundant work. The number of collisions between cars of different positions is the same as the number of collisions between cars of different positions in the other direction, so we only need to count the collisions in one direction and multiply the result by 2.

Therefore, the time complexity of the improved function is O(n^2 / 2), which simplifies to O(n^2). But in practice, this is a big improvement, especially for large inputs.
