### Car Collision Problem Solution
### ==============================

This script uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the car collision problem. It uses combinatorics to calculate the number of possible collisions.

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The number of possible collisions.
    """
    # Calculate the total number of pairs of cars
    total_pairs = math.comb(2 * n, 2)
    
    # Calculate the number of pairs that do not collide
    non_colliding_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) // 2
    
    # The number of collisions is the difference between total pairs and non-colliding pairs
    collisions = total_pairs - non_colliding_pairs
    
    return collisions

# Example usage
n = 5
print(f"Number of collisions with {n} cars in each set: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

This script uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the number of combinations of 2 cars from 2n cars, which represents the total number of pairs of cars. It then calculates the number of non-colliding pairs by summing the number of pairs of cars moving in the same direction. Finally, it subtracts the number of non-colliding pairs from the total number of pairs to get the number of collisions.

The time complexity of this script is O(1), making it efficient for large inputs. The space complexity is O(1) as well, as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.
