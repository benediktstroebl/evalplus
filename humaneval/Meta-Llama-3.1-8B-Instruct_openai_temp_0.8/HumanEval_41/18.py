### Car Collision Problem

#### Problem Statement

Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.

#### Solution

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of car collisions.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    
    # Sort the cars by their positions
    left_cars = list(range(n))  # Positions of cars moving left to right
    right_cars = list(range(n-1, -1, -1))  # Positions of cars moving right to left
    
    # Sort the lists of car positions
    left_cars.sort()
    right_cars.sort()
    
    # Initialize the collision count and the current position in both lists
    collisions = 0
    left_index = 0
    right_index = 0
    
    # Compare the positions of the cars
    while left_index < n and right_index < n:
        # If the left car is to the left of the right car, they collide
        if left_cars[left_index] < right_cars[right_index]:
            collisions += 1
            left_index += 1
            right_index += 1
        # If the right car is to the left of the left car, they collide
        elif left_cars[left_index] > right_cars[right_index]:
            collisions += 1
            left_index += 1
            right_index += 1
        # If the cars are at the same position, they do not collide
        else:
            left_index += 1
            right_index += 1
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 5
```
This script sorts the positions of the cars moving left to right and right to left, and then compares the positions to count the number of collisions. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
