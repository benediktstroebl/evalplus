In this script, the `car_race_collision` function calculates the number of collisions by counting the total number of pairs of cars that can collide. Each pair of cars can collide only once, so the total number of collisions equals the total number of pairs. We use the formula for combinations (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) to calculate the total number of pairs, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2` where `n` is the number of cars.
