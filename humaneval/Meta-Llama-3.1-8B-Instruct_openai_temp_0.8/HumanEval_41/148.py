### Car Collision Function
#### Problem Description
This script defines a function `car_race_collision(n: int)` to calculate the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

#### Problem Assumptions
1. All cars move at the same speed.
2. Cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving after a collision.
3. Cars moving left to right and right to left start very far from each other.

#### Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race scenario.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    # This is because each collision involves one car from the left-to-right set and one car from the right-to-left set.
    # The number of pairs of cars from different sets that collide is equal to the number of positions where a car from the left-to-right set can be.
    # This is because each position where a car from the left-to-right set can be corresponds to a pair of cars from different sets that collide.
    # Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    collisions = n * (n + 1) // 2
    return collisions

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 15
```
This script defines a function `car_race_collision(n: int)` to calculate the number of collisions in a car race scenario. It uses the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, `n * (n + 1) / 2`, to calculate the number of collisions. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with `n = 5` and print the result.
