```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race.
    
    The idea is that when two cars collide, they essentially "pass each other by".
    This can be modeled as choosing n pairs of cars from a group of 2n cars. The
    number of ways to choose n pairs is (2n)! / (n!^2) (each pair can be chosen
    in (2n - 1) choose (n - 1) ways). The number of collisions is then calculated
    as the number of ways to choose n pairs, but since the order of the pairs
    doesn't matter, we need to divide by n!.

    However, since the order of the cars within each pair doesn't matter, we can
    further simplify the calculation to just (2n)! / (n! * n!), which corresponds
    to choosing n elements from a set of 2n elements, and then choosing the other
    n elements from the remaining elements (with repetition allowed).

    :param n: The number of cars driving in each direction
    :return: The number of collisions

    import math
    # Calculate the total number of collisions
    collisions = math.factorial(2*n) / (math.factorial(n) * math.factorial(n))
    
    return int(collisions)

# Example usage:
n = 3  # Number of cars driving in each direction
print("Number of collisions:", car_race_collision(n))
```

This script defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the number of collisions in a car race. It uses the mathematical concept of combinations to count the number of ways to choose pairs of cars, and then simplifies the calculation using factorials. The script then tests the function with an example input of `n = 3`.
