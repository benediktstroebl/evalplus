### Car Collision Problem Solution

The problem can be solved by considering the cars as points on the real number line. When two cars collide, it means that their positions are the same at some point in time. This can be represented by the equation `x1 + t = -x2`, where `x1` and `x2` are the initial positions of the two cars, and `t` is the time at which they collide.

We can use the concept of a sorting algorithm to solve this problem. First, we sort the positions of the cars driving left to right and the positions of the cars driving right to left. Then, we iterate over the sorted positions and count the number of pairs of cars that collide.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function outputs the number of collisions in a simultaneous car race.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Generate random positions for the cars driving left to right
    left_to_right = sorted([random.randint(1, 10**6) for _ in range(n)])
    
    # Generate random positions for the cars driving right to left
    right_to_left = sorted([-random.randint(1, 10**6) for _ in range(n)])
    
    # Initialize the collision count
    collisions = 0
    
    # Iterate over the positions of the cars driving left to right
    for i, x1 in enumerate(left_to_right):
        # Iterate over the positions of the cars driving right to left
        for x2 in right_to_left:
            # Check if the cars collide
            if x1 + abs(x2) <= 0:
                collisions += 1
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
import random
print(car_race_collision(10))
```

In this script, we use the `sorted()` function to sort the positions of the cars driving left to right and the positions of the cars driving right to left. We then iterate over the sorted positions and count the number of pairs of cars that collide by checking if the equation `x1 + abs(x2) = 0` is satisfied.

Note that the script generates random positions for the cars driving left to right and the cars driving right to left. You can modify the range of the random numbers to suit your needs.

Also, the time complexity of this script is O(n^2), where n is the number of cars. This is because we iterate over the positions of the cars driving left to right and the positions of the cars driving right to left, and for each pair of positions, we check if the cars collide.
