Here's a Python script that solves the car race collision problem:

### Car Race Collision Problem

This script calculates the number of collisions between cars moving left to right 
and cars moving right to left on a straight, infinitely long line.

```python
def calculate_collisions(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars moving in each direction.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
    """
    # The formula to calculate the number of collisions is (n*(n-1)) / 2
    # This is because each car will collide with every other car except itself
    # We use the combination formula "n choose 2" to calculate this, which is (n*(n-1)) / 2
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars moving in each direction.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
    """
    return calculate_collisions(n)

# Example usage:
n = 5  # number of cars in each direction
print(f"Number of collisions for n = {n}: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```
### Explanation

The script defines two functions: `calculate_collisions` and `car_race_collision`.

*   The `calculate_collisions` function uses the formula for combinations to calculate the number of collisions between `n` cars moving in each direction.
*   The `car_race_collision` function is a wrapper around `calculate_collisions` and provides a more descriptive function name.
*   The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the `car_race_collision` function with a specific value of `n` and print the result.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this script is O(1) because it uses a constant-time formula to calculate the number of collisions.
