    # Since all cars move at the same speed, the number of collisions is equivalent to 
    # the number of pairs of cars that can be formed. This is calculated using the formula n*(n-1)//2
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    
    # The number of collisions is the same as the number of pairs, so return total_pairs

This script takes the number of cars as input and returns the number of collisions that will occur. The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can be formed, which is calculated using the formula `n*(n-1)//2`. This is because each car can potentially collide with every other car, except itself.
