### Collision Detection in a Car Race
#### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

#### Solution
We can represent the two groups of cars as two sequences of integers: `left` and `right`. These sequences contain the distances traveled by each car in the respective groups.

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each group.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the sequences for the distances traveled by each car
    left = list(range(1, n + 1))
    right = list(range(n, 2 * n + 1))

    # Initialize a variable to count the number of collisions
    collisions = 0

    # Iterate over the sequences
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the difference between the current distances
        diff = left[i] + right[n - i - 1]

        # If the difference is equal, increment the collision count
        if diff == 0:
            collisions += 1
        # If the difference is less than 0, increment the collision count by the difference
        elif diff < 0:
            collisions += diff

    return collisions
```

#### Example Usage
```python
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 6
```
This script calculates the number of collisions in a car race with `n` cars in each group. It uses a simple and efficient algorithm to iterate over the sequences of distances traveled by each car and count the number of collisions. The time complexity of this script is O(n), making it suitable for large inputs.
