    This function calculates the number of collisions between n cars driving left to right
    and n cars driving right to left in a straight infinitely long line.

    Args:

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the number of collisions to 0
    collisions = 0
    
    # For each pair of cars (one moving left to right and one moving right to left)
    for left_right in range(1, n + 1):
        for right_left in range(1, n + 1):
            # Calculate the distance between the cars. This is the difference between their positions
            distance = abs(left_right - right_left)
            
            # If the distance between the cars is less than or equal to their combined speed,
            # it means they will collide
            if distance <= left_right + right_left:
                # Increment the number of collisions
                collisions += 1
    
    # Return the total number of collisions
    return collisions

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))
```

This script works by iterating over each pair of cars and checking if they will collide based on their distance from each other. If the distance is less than or equal to their combined speed, it increments the number of collisions. Finally, it returns the total number of collisions.

However, this script has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested for loops, which may not be efficient for large inputs.

A more efficient solution would involve using combinatorics to calculate the number of collisions without iterating over each pair of cars.

Here's an optimized version of the function:

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between n cars driving left to right
    and n cars driving right to left in a straight infinitely long line.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Calculate the number of collisions using the formula for combinations
    collisions = math.comb(2 * n, 2) - n
    
    # Return the total number of collisions
    return collisions

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))
```

This optimized version uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the number of combinations of 2 cars from a total of 2n cars, and then subtracts the number of cars to get the number of collisions. This approach has a time complexity of O(1), making it more efficient for large inputs.
