### Solution: Car Race Collision Problem
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars driving in opposite directions.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Since all cars move at the same speed, we can assume the first car in each set to be at positions 0 and n+1.
    # When the first car in the left-to-right set moves to position n+1, all the cars in the left-to-right set will have moved 1 position to the right.
    # Similarly, when the first car in the right-to-left set moves to position 0, all the cars in the right-to-left set will have moved 1 position to the left.
    # So, the first car in the left-to-right set will collide with all the cars in the right-to-left set that are between positions 0 and n+1.
    # This is equivalent to the number of elements in a set of size n, which is n.

    # Therefore, the total number of collisions is n.
    return n

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 5
```
This solution assumes that the first car in each set is at positions 0 and n+1, and calculates the number of collisions based on this assumption. The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only involves a constant number of operations.
