### Collisions in a Car Race
#### Python Script to Calculate Collisions

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions in a car race with n cars moving left to right
    and n cars moving right to left.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars moving in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # The number of collisions between two sets of n cars is equal to the sum of the first n-1 integers
    # This is because each car on the left will collide with every car on the right that's to its right
    # So the number of collisions for each car on the left is equal to its position in the sequence
    # We use the formula for the sum of the first n-1 integers: n*(n-1)//2
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 5  # Number of cars
    collision_count = car_race_collision(n)
    print(f"Number of collisions when {n} cars are moving in each direction: {collision_count}")
```

This script uses the formula for the sum of the first n-1 integers to calculate the number of collisions. The formula is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, where `n` is the number of cars moving in each direction.

This code is well-structured, readable, and includes a docstring that explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result.
