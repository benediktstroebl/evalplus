### Car Collision Problem Solution
#### Problem Statement
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. 
n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars 
are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from 
each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide 
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving 
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

#### Solution
```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of car collisions.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of car collisions.
    """
    # A car driving left to right will collide with a car driving right to left
    # if the second car's starting position is within the first car's path.
    # For n cars, the total number of collisions will be n*(n-1)//2.
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

# Example usage
num_cars = 5
print(f"Number of car collisions for {num_cars} cars: {car_race_collision(num_cars)}")
```

This script calculates the number of collisions between n pairs of cars using the formula for combinations, which in this case simplifies to n*(n-1)//2. This is because the number of ways to choose two cars from a set of n cars is n*(n-1)//2, and each pair of cars will collide.
