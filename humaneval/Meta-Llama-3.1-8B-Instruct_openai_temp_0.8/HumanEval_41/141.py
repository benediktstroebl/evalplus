Here's a Python script that solves the car collision problem using stars and bars.

### Car Collision Problem
#### Python Solution

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between cars moving left to right
    and cars moving right to left on an infinitely long road.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the number of collisions to 0
    collisions = 0
    
    # For each pair of cars, calculate the number of ways they can collide
    for i in range(n):
        # The i-th car can collide with any of the (n - i - 1) cars to its right
        # This is because we're choosing the position where the collision occurs
        collisions += (n - i - 1)
    
    # The total number of collisions is half the sum of the number of collisions for each pair
    # This is because each collision is counted twice (once for each car involved)
    return collisions // 2
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Test the function with 5 cars in each direction
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
```

This solution works by iterating over each car in the left-to-right direction and calculating the number of ways it can collide with each of the cars in the right-to-left direction. The number of ways a collision can occur between two cars is equal to the number of positions where the collision can occur, which is the number of cars to the right of the current car. The total number of collisions is then calculated by summing up the number of collisions for each pair of cars and dividing by 2 to account for the fact that each collision is counted twice.
