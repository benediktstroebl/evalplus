```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions.

    The idea is to use the concept of stars and bars to generate all possible collisions.
    We can represent the positions of the cars on the road by arranging n stars (left-to-right cars) and n bars (right-to-left cars).
    The number of collisions is then the number of ways to arrange these stars and bars, which is (2n)! / (n! \* n!).

    :param n: The number of cars in each set.
    :return: The total number of collisions.
    """
    import math

    # Calculate the number of collisions using the stars and bars method
    collisions = math.comb(2 * n, n)

    return collisions

# Example usage:
n = 5  # Number of cars in each set
print(f"Number of collisions for {n} cars in each set: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

This script uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the number of ways to choose `n` positions out of `2n` positions, which is equivalent to arranging `n` stars and `n` bars. The result is the total number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
