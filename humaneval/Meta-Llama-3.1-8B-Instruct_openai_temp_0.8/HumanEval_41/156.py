### Car Collision Problem
#### Solution in Python
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between cars moving left to right and right to left.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars moving left to right and right to left.
    
    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
    """
    # The total number of collisions will be the sum of the first n natural numbers
    # because for the first car moving left to right, there will be n-1 cars moving right to left
    # for the second car moving left to right, there will be n-2 cars moving right to left, and so on
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(f"The number of collisions when n = {n} is: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

### Explanation:
- The problem can be solved by realizing that each car moving left to right will collide with all the cars moving right to left except for itself.
- This forms a series where the total number of collisions is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
- This series can be expressed as n * (n - 1) / 2, which is the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers.
- In the example usage, we calculate the number of collisions when n = 5 and print the result.
