### Car Collision Problem Solution
#### Problem Statement
The problem describes a car racing scenario where two sets of `n` cars are moving towards each other from opposite directions. We need to find the number of collisions between these cars.

#### Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between left-to-right and right-to-left cars.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Calculate the total number of points of intersection
    total_intersections = n * (n - 1) // 2
    
    # Since each pair of cars has two points of intersection (one for each direction),
    # multiply the total intersections by 2
    total_intersections *= 2
    
    # Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, each intersection contributes to only one collision.
    # So, return the total intersections as the number of collisions.
    return total_intersections

# Example usage:
n = 5  # number of cars in each direction
collisions = car_race_collision(n)
print(f"The number of collisions is: {collisions}")
```
#### Explanation
The solution calculates the number of collisions using the following steps:

1.  Calculate the total number of points of intersection using the formula for combinations: `n * (n - 1) / 2`. This formula gives us the number of unique pairs of cars that can intersect.
2.  Multiply the total intersections by 2, since each pair of cars has two points of intersection (one for each direction).
3.  Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, each intersection contributes to only one collision. Therefore, we return the total intersections as the number of collisions.
