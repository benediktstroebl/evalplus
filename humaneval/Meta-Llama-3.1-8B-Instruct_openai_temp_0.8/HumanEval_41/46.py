```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car race with n cars
    driving left to right and n cars driving right to left.

    The idea here is to treat the cars as points on a line, and for each car driving
    left to right, find the number of cars driving right to left that it can collide
    with. We can do this by using the fact that the number of collisions for a
    particular car is equal to the number of cars that are to its left.

    Therefore, the total number of collisions is the sum of the positions of all
    the cars driving left to right.

    :param n: The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.
    :return: The number of collisions in the car race.
    """
    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers
    # This is the total number of collisions
    total_collisions = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
    return total_collisions

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(f"Number of collisions for {n} cars: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

This script uses the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to the sum of the arithmetic series `1 + 2 + 3 +... + n`. The formula works for any positive integer n.
