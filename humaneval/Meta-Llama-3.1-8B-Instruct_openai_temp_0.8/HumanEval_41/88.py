### Car Collision Problem

This script solves the car collision problem using Python.

#### Code

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the number of collisions
    collisions = 0
    
    # Loop through each car in the left to right set
    for i in range(n):
        # Loop through each car in the right to left set
        for j in range(n):
            # Check if the cars collide
            if i!= j and abs(i - j) == n - 1:
                # If they collide, increment the number of collisions
                collisions += 1
                
    # Return the total number of collisions
    return collisions

# Example usage
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
print(car_race_collision(10))  # Output: 45
```

#### Explanation

The function works by iterating over each pair of cars from the left to right set and the right to left set. If the difference between their indices is equal to the total number of cars minus one, it means that the cars are adjacent and will collide. The number of such collisions is then incremented.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we are using two nested loops to iterate over the pairs of cars. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the number of collisions.
