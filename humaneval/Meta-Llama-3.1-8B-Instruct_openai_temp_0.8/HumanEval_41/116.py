### Collision Detector for Car Race
#### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. Two sets of `n` cars are driving in opposite directions simultaneously. All cars move at the same speed. We need to calculate the number of collisions between these two sets of cars.

#### Python Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # The total number of pairs of cars is n * (n - 1) / 2, but we need to consider that
    # each pair can result in at most one collision. So, we can simply return n * (n - 1) / 2.
    # This is because each car in the first set can collide with all cars in the second set,
    # except itself (since it can't collide with itself), so we subtract 1 from n.
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
#### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics. Each car in the first set can collide with all cars in the second set, except itself. Therefore, for each car in the first set, there are `n - 1` possible collisions. Since there are `n` cars in the first set, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1)`. However, we need to divide this by 2 to avoid counting each collision twice (once from the perspective of each car involved in the collision).

#### Example Use Case
```python
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
```
This will print the number of collisions between two sets of 5 cars moving in opposite directions.
