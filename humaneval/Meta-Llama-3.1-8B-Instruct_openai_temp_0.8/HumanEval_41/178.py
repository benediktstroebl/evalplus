```python

    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions in a car racing scenario.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of collisions.

    # Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) which is the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series
    # This sum represents the number of pairs of cars that can potentially collide
    potential_collisions = n * (n + 1) // 2

    # Since each pair of cars can potentially collide, the total number of collisions is equal to the number of potential pairs

n = 5  # Number of cars in each direction
print(car_race_collision(n))  # Outputs the total number of collisions
```

This script uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the number of potential pairs of cars that can collide. The total number of collisions is equal to this number of potential pairs, as each pair of cars can potentially collide.
