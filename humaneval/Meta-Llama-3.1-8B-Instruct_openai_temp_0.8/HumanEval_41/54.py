### Car Collision Problem Solution
#### Problem Description
Given `n` cars driving left to right and another `n` cars driving right to left on a straight infinitely long line, 
calculate the number of collisions between the two sets of cars. Cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving 
after collision.

#### Solution in Python

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars driving left to right and right to left on a straight road.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide.
    # This is equivalent to the number of pairs of numbers from 1 to n.
    # We use the formula for combinations to calculate this: n choose 2.
    import math
    return math.comb(n, 2)

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
```
This solution uses the `math.comb` function, which is available in Python 3.8 and later, to calculate the number of combinations of `n` items taken `k` at a time, where `k` is 2 in this case. This is equivalent to the number of pairs of numbers from 1 to `n`. 

In earlier versions of Python, you can use the following solution:

```python
import math

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars driving left to right and right to left on a straight road.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide.
    # This is equivalent to the number of pairs of numbers from 1 to n.
    # We use the formula for combinations: n*(n-1)/2.
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

# Example usage:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10
```
