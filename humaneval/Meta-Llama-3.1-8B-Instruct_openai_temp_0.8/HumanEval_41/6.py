### Car Collision Problem Solution
#### Problem Description
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. `n` cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of `n` cars are driving right to left. All cars move at the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

#### Solution
```markdown
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    This function outputs the number of collisions in a car race.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars driving left to right and right to left.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions in the car race.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```

#### Explanation
This solution calculates the number of collisions in the car race. It uses the combination formula to determine the number of pairs of cars that can collide. The formula is `n * (n - 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of cars driving left to right (or right to left).

This is because each of the `n` cars can collide with every other car except itself. Therefore, the total number of possible collisions is `n` times the number of other cars (`n - 1`). However, since each pair of cars results in one collision, we divide the result by 2 to avoid double-counting.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since it only involves a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input `n` and the result.
