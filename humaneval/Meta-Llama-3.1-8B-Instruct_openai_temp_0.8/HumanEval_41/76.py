### Car Race Collision Problem
#### Solution
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars driving in opposite directions.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize variable to store total collisions
    total_collisions = 0
    
    # Loop through each car in the first set
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the number of collisions for this car
        # A car will collide with every other car to its right, except for itself
        collisions = n - i - 1
        
        # Add the collisions for this car to the total
        total_collisions += collisions
    
    # Since each collision is counted twice (once for each car involved), divide by 2
    total_collisions //= 2
    
    return total_collisions
```

#### Example Use Cases
```python
# Test the function with 5 cars in each set
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 10

# Test the function with 10 cars in each set
print(car_race_collision(10))  # Output: 45
```
This solution works by iterating over each car in the first set and calculating the number of collisions for that car. It does this by subtracting the car's position from the total number of cars, since a car will collide with every other car to its right. The total number of collisions is then divided by 2 to account for the fact that each collision is counted twice.
