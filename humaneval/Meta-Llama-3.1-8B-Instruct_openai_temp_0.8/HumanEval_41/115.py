This script works by considering all possible pairs of car positions (x1, x2) where x1 < x2 and then using the difference x2 - x1 as a key to store the frequency of each collision position in a dictionary. The total number of collisions is then calculated by summing the product of the frequency and its index for each difference.

The time complexity of this script is O(n^2) where n is the number of cars, and the space complexity is also O(n^2) for storing the frequency of each collision position in the dictionary.
