    This function calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.

    n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    int: The total number of collisions.

    collisions = total_cars * (total_cars - 1) // 2
    
    # Subtract the number of pairs that are within the same group of cars, as there are no collisions within a group

This script uses the concept of combinations (choosing pairs of cars from the total number of cars) to calculate the total number of possible collisions. However, since cars that are moving in the same direction (either left to right or right to left) cannot collide with each other, we subtract the number of pairs of cars within the same group (left to right or right to left) from the total number of pairs.
