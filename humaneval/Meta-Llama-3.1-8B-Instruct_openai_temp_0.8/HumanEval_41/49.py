### Car Collision Problem
#### Problem Description

Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. `n` cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of `n` cars are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

#### Solution

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars driving in opposite directions.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Initialize the count of collisions
    collisions = 0
    
    # Each car in one set will collide with the car in the other set that is n - i - 1 places to its right.
    # So, we sum up the count of collisions from i = 0 to n - 1.
    for i in range(n):
        # For each car in the first set, we get a collision with the corresponding car in the second set
        collisions += 1
    
    # Return the total number of collisions
    return collisions

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(f"The number of collisions for {n} cars in each set is {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of cars in each set. This is because we iterate over each car in one set once to calculate the number of collisions.
