This script calculates the number of collisions in a car race scenario where n cars are moving left to right and another n cars are moving right to left. The cars continue moving in their trajectory even after a collision. The function sorts the cars in ascending order of their positions and then iterates through the right-to-left moving cars, counting the number of left-to-right moving cars that are behind each one. The total number of collisions is returned.
