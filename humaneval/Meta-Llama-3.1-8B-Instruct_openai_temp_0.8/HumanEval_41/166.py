### Car Collision Problem
#### Solution Using Python

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars,
    one moving left to right and the other right to left.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each set.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
    """
    # Each car in the left set will collide with n cars in the right set
    # However, we need to account for the fact that each car in the right set
    # will collide with n cars in the left set except for the last car in the
    # left set which will not collide with any car in the right set.
    # The same reasoning applies to the right set.
    # Therefore, the number of collisions is the square of n minus n.
    return n**2 - n

# Example use case:
print(car_race_collision(5))  # Output: 20
```

This script calculates the number of collisions between two sets of n cars, one moving left to right and the other right to left. It does this by first understanding the collision pattern and then deriving a mathematical formula to calculate the total number of collisions.
