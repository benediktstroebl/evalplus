### Car Collision Problem
Collision detection between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinite road.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars in each direction.

    Returns:
        int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Since all cars are equally likely to collide with each other, 
    # the total number of collisions is the sum of the number of collisions 
    # each car in the first set can have with all the cars in the second set.
    # This is equivalent to the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    # However, since each collision is counted twice (once for each car involved), 
    # we divide the total by 2 to avoid counting collisions twice.
    return sum(range(1, n + 1)) // 2


# Example usage
n = 10  # number of cars in each direction
print(f"Number of collisions: {car_race_collision(n)}")
```

This code defines a function `car_race_collision` that calculates the total number of collisions between two sets of `n` cars moving in opposite directions. It uses the mathematical property that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n*(n+1)/2`, and divides this value by 2 to avoid counting collisions twice. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the total number of collisions. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a specific value of `n` and print the result.
