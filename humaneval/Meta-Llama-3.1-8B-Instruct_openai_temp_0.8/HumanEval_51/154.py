This script defines a function `remove_vowels` that takes a string as input and returns a new string without vowels. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and includes only the characters that are not vowels. The `join` method is then used to concatenate these characters into a single string. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.
