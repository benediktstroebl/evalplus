    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.

    Returns:
    str: The input string without vowels.

This script defines a function `remove_vowels` that uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string. If a character is not a vowel (as determined by its presence in the string `vowels`), it is included in the new string. The `join` method is then used to concatenate these characters into a single string. The script includes the provided test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
