This script now correctly calculates the root of a polynomial using the formula for the root of a quadratic equation, which is `x = -b / a`. The coefficients are rearranged so that the highest degree coefficient is at the start of the list, and the script then uses this to calculate the root of the polynomial. The script also checks if the list has an even number of coefficients, and raises a `ValueError` if it doesn't.
