### Newton-Raphson Method for Finding a Root of a Polynomial

```python
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where the first coefficient is the constant term.
        x (float): Point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
        float: The value of the polynomial at x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * np.power(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def derivative(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where the first coefficient is the constant term.
        x (float): Point at which to evaluate the derivative.
    
    Returns:
        float: The value of the derivative at x.

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a root of the polynomial with coefficients xs using the Newton-Raphson method.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where the first coefficient is the constant term.
    
    Returns:
        float: A root of the polynomial.
    
    Notes:
        This method only works for polynomials of even degree. If the highest degree term is zero, it will not work.

This script uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. The `poly` function evaluates the polynomial at a given point, and the `derivative` function evaluates the derivative of the polynomial at a given point. The `find_zero` function uses these two functions to find a root of the polynomial. It starts with an arbitrary initial value for x and iteratively updates x using the Newton-Raphson formula until it finds a root.
