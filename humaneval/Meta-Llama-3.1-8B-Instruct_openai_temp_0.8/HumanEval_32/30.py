However, the above solution is an approximation and does not guarantee to find the exact root of the polynomial. A more precise solution would be to use the `numpy.roots` function.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds x such that poly(x) = 0 given coefficients of a polynomial.
    
    Parameters:
    xs (list): coefficients of a polynomial
    
    Returns:
    float: x such that poly(x) = 0
    """
    # Check if the polynomial is of even degree and the leading coefficient is not zero
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0 or xs[-1] == 0:
        raise ValueError("The polynomial must be of even degree and the leading coefficient must be non-zero.")
    
    return np.roots(xs)[0].real

# Test the function
try:
    print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
