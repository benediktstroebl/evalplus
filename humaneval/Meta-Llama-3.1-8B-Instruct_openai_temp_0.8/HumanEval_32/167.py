### Problem Solution: Finding a Zero of a Polynomial
#### Implementation using Python

```python
import math
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds x such that poly(x) = 0.

    Args:
    xs (list): coefficients of a polynomial.

    Returns:
    float: a zero point of the polynomial.
    """
    def equation(x):
        return poly(xs, x)

    # Use fsolve to find the root
    # initial guess is 0.0
    root = fsolve(equation, 0.0)
    return root[0]

# Example usage
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
In this code:

*   We use NumPy and SciPy to efficiently solve the equation.
*   The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input and returns a zero point of the polynomial.
*   We use the `fsolve` function from SciPy to find the root of the polynomial equation.
*   We provide an initial guess of 0.0 for the root, but you can adjust this based on your specific problem.
*   The code includes example usage to demonstrate how to use the `find_zero` function.
