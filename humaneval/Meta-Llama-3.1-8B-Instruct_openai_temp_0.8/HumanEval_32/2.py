This script defines the `poly` function as before, but it also implements the `find_zero` function. The `find_zero` function uses the formula for the root of a quadratic equation to find one root of the polynomial. The function assumes that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end of the list.

The script also includes test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the `find_zero` function.
