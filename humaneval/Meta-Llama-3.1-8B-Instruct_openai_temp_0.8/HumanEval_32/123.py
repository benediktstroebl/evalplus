### Zero Finder for Polynomials

Below is a Python script that solves the problem using the numpy library for efficient polynomial evaluation.

```python
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial.
    x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    float: The value of the polynomial at the given point.
    """
    return np.polyval(xs[::-1], x)


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds the zero of a polynomial given its coefficients.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    float: The zero of the polynomial.
    
    Note:
    This function assumes that the input list has an even number of coefficients
    and that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end of the list.
    """
    # Reverse the list of coefficients to match the expected format of np.polyval
    xs = xs[::-1]
    
    # Find the zero of the polynomial using numpy's roots function
    roots = np.roots(xs)
    
    # Return the real root
    return roots[np.isreal(roots)][0].real

# Example usage
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This script uses numpy's `polyval` function to evaluate the polynomial at a given point and `roots` function to find the zero of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function returns the real zero of the polynomial.
