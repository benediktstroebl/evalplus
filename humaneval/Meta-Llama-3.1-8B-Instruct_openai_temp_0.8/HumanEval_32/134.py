Note: This code assumes that the input list represents a quadratic equation. If the input list represents a polynomial of degree n, where n > 2, you will need to use a more complex method to find the roots, such as the `numpy.roots` function.

Here's an updated version of the code that uses the `numpy.roots` function to find the roots of any polynomial:

```python
