Please note that the above solution uses an approximation of a root, which may not be exact due to the limitations of floating point arithmetic. The `math.pow` function is also not the most efficient way to calculate powers in Python, as it is a call to the C standard library function `pow`. A more efficient way would be to use the `**` operator or a library like `numpy`.

Also, this solution still doesn't handle cases where there are multiple roots to the polynomial, as it will only return one root. If you need to handle multiple roots, you would need a more advanced method, such as using the `numpy.roots` function.
