This modified version of `find_zero` uses the `numpy` library to calculate the roots of the polynomial. The polynomial is constructed by taking the coefficients with even powers and reversing the order of the coefficients to match the order used in `poly`. The `np.roots` function is then used to calculate the roots of the polynomial. The function then returns the largest real root. 

The script also includes error checking to ensure that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements, which is a required condition for the function to work correctly. 

Note that the `numpy` library should be installed if it's not already. You can install it with `pip install numpy`.
