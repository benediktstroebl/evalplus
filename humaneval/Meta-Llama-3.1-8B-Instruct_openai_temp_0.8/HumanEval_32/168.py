# Evaluating Polynomial and Finding Zero Points
=============================================

This script defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, to evaluate a polynomial at a given point and to find a zero point of the polynomial, respectively.

## Evaluating Polynomial
------------------------

The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`.

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n

    Args:
    xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial
    x (float): point to evaluate the polynomial at

    Returns:
    float: value of the polynomial at point x
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])
```

## Finding Zero Points
---------------------

The `find_zero` function finds a zero point of the polynomial with coefficients `xs`. It returns only one zero point, even if there are many. It only takes lists `xs` with an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient.

```python
def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of the polynomial with coefficients xs.

    Args:
    xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial

    Returns:
    float: a zero point of the polynomial

    Raises:
    ValueError: if xs does not have an even number of coefficients or if the largest non-zero coefficient is zero
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have an even number of coefficients")
    if max(coeffs for coeffs in xs if coeffs!= 0) == 0:
        raise ValueError("largest non-zero coefficient is zero")

    n = len(xs) // 2
    a, b = xs[-1], xs[-2] / xs[-1]
    return -b / (2 * a)
```

### Example Usage
```python
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
# Output: -0.5

print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
# Output: 1.0
```

Note: The `find_zero` function assumes that the polynomial has real coefficients and that the largest non-zero coefficient is the leading coefficient of the polynomial. It does not check if the polynomial has any complex roots.
