This script defines two functions: `poly` to evaluate a polynomial at a given point, and `find_zero` to find a root of a polynomial using Newton's method. The `find_zero` function assumes that the input coefficients have an even number of terms and that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end. It also checks for convergence and limits the number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.
