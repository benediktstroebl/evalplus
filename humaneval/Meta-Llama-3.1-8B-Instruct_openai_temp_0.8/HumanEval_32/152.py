### Find Zero of a Polynomial

This script defines a function `find_zero` which finds the root of a polynomial with even number of coefficients, where the largest non-zero coefficient is in the first position.

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds the root of a polynomial with even number of coefficients,
    where the largest non-zero coefficient is in the first position.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial.
        
    Returns:
        float: the root of the polynomial.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: if the input list has an odd number of coefficients
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Newton-Raphson method parameters
    x = 1.0  # initial guess
    epsilon = 1e-6  # precision
    max_iterations = 100  # maximum number of iterations
    
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        # calculate polynomial and derivative at x
        poly_x = poly(xs, x)
        poly_dx = poly([i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs[1:])], x)
        
        # update x
        x = x - poly_x / poly_dx
        
        # check convergence
        if abs(poly_x) < epsilon:
            break
    
    return round(x, 2)  # round to two decimal places

# Test cases
print("Test case 1:")
print(find_zero([1, 2]))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x

print("\nTest case 2:")
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This script uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial, which is a popular and efficient method for root finding. The initial guess for `x` is set to 1.0, and the precision is set to 1e-6. The maximum number of iterations is set to 100. The script raises a `ValueError` if the input list has an odd number of coefficients. The test cases demonstrate the usage of the `find_zero` function with two different polynomials.
