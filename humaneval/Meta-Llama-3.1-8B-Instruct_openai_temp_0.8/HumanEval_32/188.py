Note that the `find_zero` function now uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial, rather than relying on a guaranteed solution. This is because the problem statement's guarantee of a solution requires an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient as the first term, which is not necessarily a root of the polynomial.

Also note that the `find_zero` function now raises a `ValueError` if the input list does not have an even number of coefficients.
