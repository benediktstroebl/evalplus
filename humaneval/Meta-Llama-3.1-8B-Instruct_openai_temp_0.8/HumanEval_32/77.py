### Evaluating Polynomials and Finding Zeroes
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.

    Args:
    - xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where xs[i] is the coefficient of x^i.
    - x (float): Point at which to evaluate the polynomial.

    Returns:
    - float: The value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of the polynomial given by coefficients xs.

    Args:
    - xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where xs[i] is the coefficient of x^i.
        The list must have an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient.
        This function finds one zero, even if there are many.

    Returns:
    - float: A zero of the polynomial.
    """
    # Check if the list has an even number of elements
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("List must have an even number of elements")

    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient
    max_coeff = max(coeff for coeff in xs if coeff!= 0)

    # Find the index of the largest non-zero coefficient
    max_index = len(xs) - 1 - xs[::-1].index(max_coeff)

    # Start with an initial guess for the zero
    x = -xs[max_index] / (max_coeff * 2)

    # Use Newton's method to find a zero
    for _ in range(10):  # 10 iterations should be enough for most cases
        x = x - poly(xs, x) / poly([i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if coeff!= 0], x)

    return x

# Example usage
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
Note that the `find_zero` function uses Newton's method to find a zero of the polynomial. This method is a good choice for finding roots of polynomials, as it converges quickly to the root. However, it requires an initial guess for the root, and may not find the closest root if there are many roots close together.
