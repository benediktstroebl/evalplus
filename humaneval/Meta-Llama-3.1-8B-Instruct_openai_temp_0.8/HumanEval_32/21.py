Here is a well-documented and self-contained Python script that solves the given problem:

### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finder

#### Requirements

* Python 3.x

#### Code
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial
        x (float): Point at which to evaluate the polynomial
    
    Returns:
        float: Value of the polynomial at point x
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of a polynomial with coefficients xs.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial
    
    Returns:
        float: A zero of the polynomial
    
    Notes:
        This function assumes the input list xs has an even number of coefficients
        and the largest non-zero coefficient. It uses a numerical method to find a zero.
    """
    # Check if the input list has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Check if the largest non-zero coefficient is positive
    max_coeff = max(coeff for coeff in xs if coeff!= 0)
    if max_coeff <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Largest non-zero coefficient must be positive")
    
    # Use the numpy roots function to find the zeros of the polynomial
    coefficients = xs[::-1]  # Reverse the list of coefficients
    roots = np.roots(coefficients)
    
    # Return the first zero found
    return roots[0].real  # Return the real part of the first root

# Test the functions
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This script uses the `numpy` library to find the roots of the polynomial, which is a more efficient and robust method than using a numerical method like the bisection method. The `find_zero` function checks if the input list has an even number of coefficients and if the largest non-zero coefficient is positive before attempting to find a zero. If these conditions are not met, it raises a `ValueError`.
