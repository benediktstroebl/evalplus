This script uses the Newton-Raphson method to estimate the root of the polynomial. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method that refines an initial guess for the root until it converges to a solution.

The time complexity of this script is O(n), where n is the number of coefficients in the polynomial, because it uses a loop to iterate over the coefficients. However, for most practical purposes, the time complexity is O(1) because the number of coefficients is constant.

The space complexity of this script is O(n) because it uses a list to store the coefficients.

Note: This script assumes that the polynomial has at least two coefficients. If the polynomial has only one coefficient, the script will raise a ValueError.
