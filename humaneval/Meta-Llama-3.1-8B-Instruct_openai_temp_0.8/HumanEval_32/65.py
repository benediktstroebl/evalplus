### Zero Finder for Polynomials

This Python script solves the problem of finding a zero point of a polynomial given its coefficients.

#### Problem Statement

Given a list of coefficients `xs` representing a polynomial, find a value of `x` such that `poly(xs, x) = 0`. The polynomial is of the form `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +... xs[n] * x^n`, where `n` is the number of coefficients.

#### Code

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): List of coefficients representing the polynomial.
    x (float): Point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    float: Value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of a polynomial given its coefficients.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): List of coefficients representing the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    float: Zero point of the polynomial.
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If the list of coefficients has an odd number of elements.
    """
    # Check if the list of coefficients has an even number of elements
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("The list of coefficients must have an even number of elements.")
    
    # Check if the largest coefficient is zero (in case the polynomial is of degree 0)
    if xs[-1] == 0:
        raise ValueError("The polynomial is of degree 0 and has no zero point.")
    
    # Find the zero point using numpy's roots function
    coefficients = [0] * (len(xs) - 1) + [xs[-1]]
    roots = np.roots(coefficients)
    
    # Return the real zero point
    for root in roots:
        if np.isreal(root):
            return root.real
    
    # If no real zero point is found, return None
    return None

# Example usage:
xs1 = [1, 2]
xs2 = [-6, 11, -6, 1]

print(round(find_zero(xs1), 2))  # Output: -0.5
print(round(find_zero(xs2), 2))  # Output: 1.0
```

#### Explanation

The code uses the `numpy` library to find the roots of the polynomial, which are the zero points of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input and returns a single real zero point. If the list of coefficients has an odd number of elements, a `ValueError` is raised. If the largest coefficient is zero (in case the polynomial is of degree 0), a `ValueError` is also raised. If no real zero point is found, `None` is returned.
