### Evaluating Polynomials and Finding Zero Points

Below is a Python script that uses the `numpy` library to efficiently evaluate polynomials and find zero points.

```python
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial in descending order of powers.
    x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    float: The value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return np.polyval(xs[::-1], x)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds one zero point of a polynomial.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial in descending order of powers.
    
    Returns:
    float: A zero point of the polynomial.
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If the list xs has an odd number of coefficients.
    """
    # Check if the list has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("The list xs must have an even number of coefficients.")
    
    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient
    max_idx = np.argmax([abs(coeff) for coeff in xs[:-1]]) + 1
    
    # Use numerical methods to find a zero point
    return np.roots(xs[::-1])[0].real

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This script first checks if the list of coefficients has an even number of elements. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it finds the largest non-zero coefficient and uses the `np.roots` function to numerically find a zero point of the polynomial. The result is the real part of the first root.

Please note that this script might not always return the exact zero point, as numerical methods can introduce small errors. However, it should be sufficient for most practical purposes.
