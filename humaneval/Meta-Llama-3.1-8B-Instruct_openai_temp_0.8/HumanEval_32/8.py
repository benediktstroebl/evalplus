### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finder
#### Problem Description
The following Python script provides two functions: `poly` and `find_zero`. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial given its coefficients and a point at which to evaluate the polynomial. The `find_zero` function finds a zero point of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients, assuming the list has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients representing the polynomial.
    x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    float: The result of evaluating the polynomial at point x.
    """
    # Ensure coefficients are in descending order
    xs = xs[::-1]
    return sum([coeff * x**i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients.

    Args:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients representing the polynomial.
              The list must have an even number of coefficients, and the largest non-zero coefficient must be at the end.

    Returns:
    float: A zero point of the polynomial.
    """
    # Check if the list has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2 == 1:
        raise ValueError("The list of coefficients must have an even number of elements.")

    # Get the coefficients (excluding the constant term)
    coeffs = xs[:-1]

    # Get the constant term
    constant = xs[-1]

    # Use numpy to find the roots of the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)

    # We assume that the roots are real and the first one is a solution
    return roots.real[0]

# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

In this script, we use the `numpy` library to find the roots of the polynomial. The `find_zero` function first checks if the list of coefficients has an even number of elements. If it does, it extracts the coefficients (excluding the constant term) and the constant term. Then, it uses `np.roots` to find the roots of the polynomial and returns the real part of the first root, assuming that the roots are real and the first one is a solution.
