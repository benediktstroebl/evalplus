Note that the `numpy` version of `find_zero` is more accurate and robust, but it may not be suitable for all use cases (e.g., very large polynomials). The iterative version using Newton's method is simpler and more suitable for small to medium-sized polynomials. 

Also, note that the `poly` function has been modified to use `len(xs) - i - 1` instead of `i` as the exponent, to match the definition of the polynomial.
