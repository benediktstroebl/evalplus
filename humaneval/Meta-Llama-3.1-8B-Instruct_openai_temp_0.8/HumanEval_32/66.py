### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finding
#### Code

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    It only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    # Ensure even number of coefficients and largest is non-zero
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0 or xs[-1] == 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid polynomial coefficients")

    # Use numpy's roots function to find all roots
    coefficients = xs[::-1]
    roots = np.roots(coefficients)

    # Return the root with the largest imaginary part
    # This is a simple way to find a real root if there are multiple
    max_imag = max(root.imag for root in roots)
    closest_real_root = next(root for root in roots if root.imag == max_imag)
    return closest_real_root.real

# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

#### Notes

- While the original implementation of `find_zero` attempted to find a root using `math.pow` and `enumerate`, this approach is inefficient and prone to numerical instability. Instead, we now use the `numpy.roots` function to find all roots of the polynomial, and select the one with the largest imaginary part (which is a simple way to find a real root if there are multiple).
- The code now includes a check to ensure that the input coefficients have an even number of elements and that the largest coefficient is non-zero. If these conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised.
