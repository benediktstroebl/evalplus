Note: The original code had a problem for polynomials of degree greater than 2, since it relied on the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of -1. This did not always converge to a solution. I have modified the code to use a more robust method of finding the root of the polynomial. However, it's worth noting that the Newton-Raphson method is not guaranteed to converge to the correct root for all initial guesses, especially for complex polynomials. For polynomials with complex roots, it's better to use a more robust method, such as the Jenkins-Traub algorithm or the Laguerre method.
