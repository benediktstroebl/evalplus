### Find Zero of a Polynomial
```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds x such that poly(x) = 0 for a polynomial with coefficients xs.

    Args:
    xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end.

    Returns:
    float: A solution to the polynomial equation, or None if no solution exists.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the input list does not have an even number of coefficients.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have an even number of coefficients")

    n = len(xs) // 2  # degree of the polynomial is half the length of xs
    a = [xs[n - i - 1] for i in range(n)]  # coefficients of the derivative
    b = [xs[n - i - 1] for i in range(n + 1)]  # coefficients of the polynomial

    def derivative(x):
        return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(a)])

    def poly(x):

    x = 1.0
    while abs(poly(x)) > 1e-6:
        x = x - poly(x) / derivative(x)

# Example usage:
print("Test 1")
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print()

print("Test 2")
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This script uses Newton's method to find a root of the polynomial. It starts with an initial guess of 1 and iteratively refines the guess until the polynomial is approximately zero. The derivative of the polynomial is used to improve the guess at each step.

Note that the `find_zero` function requires the input list to have an even number of coefficients, with the largest non-zero coefficient at the end. This is because the function uses Newton's method, which requires the derivative of the polynomial as well as the polynomial itself.

Also note that the function returns only one solution to the polynomial equation, and may not find all roots of the polynomial if there are multiple.
