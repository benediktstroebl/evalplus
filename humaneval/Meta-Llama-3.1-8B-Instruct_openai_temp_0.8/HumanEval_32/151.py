However, the above code may not work for complex roots. To find complex roots, you should use the `numpy` library or a specialized root-finding algorithm. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns a list of all zero points.
    """
    # Check if input list has even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("List xs must have an even number of coefficients.")
    
    # Find the roots using numpy
    roots = np.roots(xs)
    
    # Return the roots
    return list(roots)


# Test the function
print(find_zero([1, 2]))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This code uses the `numpy.roots` function to find all the roots of the polynomial.
