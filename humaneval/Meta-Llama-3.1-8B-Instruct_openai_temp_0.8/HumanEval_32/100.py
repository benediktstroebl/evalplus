This script defines the `poly` function to evaluate a polynomial at a given point, and the `find_zero` function to find a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients. The `find_zero` function uses the Rational Root Theorem to find possible zeros, and if none of them are actual zeros, it uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a zero. The script
