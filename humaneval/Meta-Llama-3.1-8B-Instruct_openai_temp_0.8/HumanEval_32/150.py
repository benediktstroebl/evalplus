### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finding
#### Using numpy for efficient polynomial evaluation

```python
import numpy as np
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    # Convert coefficients to numpy array for efficient evaluation
    coeffs = np.array(xs)
    # Calculate x^0, x^1,..., x^n and multiply with coefficients
    return np.polyval(coeffs[::-1], x)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    Returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    # Check if number of coefficients is even
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of coefficients must be even")
    
    # Ensure largest non-zero coefficient is first
    while len(xs) > 0 and xs[-1] == 0:
        xs.pop()
    
    # Reverse coefficients to match numpy's polyval order
    coeffs = xs[::-1]
    
    # Use numpy's roots function to find all zeros
    zeros = np.roots(coeffs)
    
    # Return the zero that is closest to the origin (0, 0)
    return zeros[np.argmin(np.abs(zeros))]

# Test the functions
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This script uses the `numpy` library for efficient polynomial evaluation. The `poly` function now uses `np.polyval` to evaluate the polynomial, and the `find_zero` function uses `np.roots` to find all zeros of the polynomial. The function then returns the zero that is closest to the origin (0, 0).
