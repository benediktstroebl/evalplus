### Polynomial Evaluation and Root Finding
```python

    Finds x such that poly(x) = 0 for a polynomial with coefficients xs.
    This function guarantees a solution if the largest non-zero coefficient is at an even index.
    It returns only one root, even if there are many.

print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x

This script uses a simple binary search to find the root of the polynomial. It first checks that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and that the largest non-zero coefficient is at an even index. It then performs a binary search to find the root, and finally returns the root. The tolerance for the root is set to 1e-6, which can be adjusted as needed.
