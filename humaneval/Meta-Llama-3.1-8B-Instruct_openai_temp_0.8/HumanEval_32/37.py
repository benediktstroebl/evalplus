This script uses the `numpy` library to create a polynomial from the coefficients and find its roots. Note that the `np.roots` function returns all roots of the polynomial, including complex ones. We check if a root is real by calling `np.isreal(root)`, and return the real part of the root if it is. If no real root exists, we return `None`.
