This script uses the `numpy` library to create a polynomial from the coefficients and find its roots. The `np.roots` function returns the roots of the polynomial, and we select the one that corresponds to the largest non-zero coefficient. If a root satisfies `np.isclose(1, atol=1e-12)`, we return it; otherwise, we try to find the first root that is 'close'. Note that this script assumes that the coefficients are real numbers and that the polynomial has at least one real root.
