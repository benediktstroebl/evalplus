This script includes the `poly` and `find_zero` functions, along with test cases to ensure they work correctly. The `find_zero` function now properly handles polynomials of degree 1 and 2, and uses the Babylonian method for higher-degree polynomials. The script also includes error checking to ensure the input list `xs` has an even number of coefficients and the largest coefficient is non-zero.
