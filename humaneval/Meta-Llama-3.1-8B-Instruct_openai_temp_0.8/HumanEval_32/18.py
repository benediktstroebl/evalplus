### Evaluating Polynomials and Finding Roots
```python
import math
import numpy as np


def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    """
    n = len(xs)  # number of coefficients
    if n % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have even number of coefficients")

    # Find the root of the polynomial using numpy's roots function
    coefficients = xs[::-1]  # reverse coefficients for numpy's roots function
    roots = np.roots(coefficients)

    # Find the root with the largest coefficient
    largest_coeff_index = np.argmax(np.abs(xs))
    for root in roots:
        if np.isclose(root, xs[largest_coeff_index]) and xs[largest_coeff_index]!= 0:
            return root


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
This script uses the `numpy` library to find the roots of the polynomial, which is more efficient and accurate than using a numerical method like the Newton-Raphson method. The `np.roots` function returns all roots of the polynomial, and we then select the root with the largest coefficient, which is the one requested by the `find_zero` function.
