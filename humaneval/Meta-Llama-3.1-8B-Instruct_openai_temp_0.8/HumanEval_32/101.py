### Finding Polynomial Roots in Python
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ 
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients 
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    
    Parameters:
    xs (list): coefficients of a polynomial

    Returns:
    float: a root of the polynomial

    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0
    """
    # Check if the number of coefficients is even
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("The number of coefficients should be even.")
    
    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient
    max_non_zero_idx = next((i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if coeff!= 0), None)
    
    # If all coefficients are zero, the polynomial is the zero polynomial
    if max_non_zero_idx is None:
        return 0.0
    
    # Initialize the root with the largest coefficient
    root = -xs[max_non_zero_idx] / (xs[max_non_zero_idx - 1] * 2.0)
    
    # Use Newton's method to refine the root
    for _ in range(10):  # Perform 10 iterations of Newton's method
        root = root - poly(xs, root) / poly([i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs[1:], 1)], root)
    
    return round(root, 2)


# Example usage:
print(find_zero([1, 2]))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
This script uses the `numpy` library for numerical computations, but it's not actually used in the `find_zero` function. It's only imported at the beginning of the script. The `find_zero` function now uses Newton's method to refine the initial estimate of the root. This should improve the accuracy of the result, especially for polynomials with many roots. 

Please note that this implementation is a simple one and might not work well for all cases, especially for polynomials with high degrees or many roots.
