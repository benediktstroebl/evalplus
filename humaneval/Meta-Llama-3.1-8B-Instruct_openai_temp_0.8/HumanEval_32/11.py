Here is a Python script that addresses the given problem in a markdown code block:
```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    
    Returns None if the list xs does not satisfy the above conditions.
    """
    # Check if the list xs has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        return None
    
    # Check if the largest coefficient is non-zero
    if xs[-1] == 0:
        return None
    
    # Calculate the root
    root = -xs[1] / xs[0]
    
    return round(root, 2)


# Test cases
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
print(find_zero([0, 1]))  # f(x) = 1
print(find_zero([1, 0]))  # f(x) = x
```

This script now includes additional test cases to verify that the `find_zero` function handles edge cases correctly. The `find_zero` function returns `None` when the input list `xs` does not satisfy the conditions for having a guaranteed solution.
