### Polynomial Root Finder

This Python script finds the root of a polynomial equation given its coefficients.

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial, where xs[i] is the coefficient of x^i.
        x (float): Point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
        float: Value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of a polynomial equation.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial.
            It must have an even number of coefficients and the largest coefficient must be non-zero.
    
    Returns:
        float: A zero point of the polynomial equation.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0 or xs[0] == 0:
        raise ValueError("The list of coefficients must have an even number of coefficients and the largest coefficient must be non-zero.")
    
    # Newton's method to find a root
    def newton(xs, x0, epsilon=1e-6, max_iter=100):
        for _ in range(max_iter):
            x1 = x0 - poly(xs, x0) / poly(xs, x0 + 1e-7) - poly(xs, x0 + 1e-7) / (2 * (x0 + 1e-7))
            if abs(x1 - x0) < epsilon:
                return x1

        return x0
    
    # Initial guess
    x0 = -1
    
    # Find a root
    return newton(xs, x0)

# Example usage
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This script uses Newton's method to find a root of the polynomial equation. The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input and returns a zero point of the polynomial equation. It first checks if the input list has an even number of coefficients and the largest coefficient is non-zero. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. The `newton` function is a helper function that implements Newton's method to find a root of the polynomial equation. The initial guess is set to -1. The script includes two example usage at the end.
