### Evaluating Polynomial and Finding Zero
```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): list of coefficients of the polynomial
    x (float): point at which to evaluate the polynomial
    
    Returns:
    float: value of the polynomial at point x
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of the polynomial defined by coefficients xs.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): list of coefficients of the polynomial
    
    Returns:
    float: one of the zeros of the polynomial
    """
    # Check if the input list has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have an even number of coefficients")

    # Check if the largest non-zero coefficient is at an even index
    max_nonzero_index = max(i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if coeff!= 0)
    if max_nonzero_index % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have the largest non-zero coefficient at an even index")

    # Use the Rational Root Theorem to find a possible zero
    factors = [p for p in range(-abs(xs[0]), abs(xs[0]) + 1) if p!= 0]
    factors.extend([-p for p in factors])

    for x in factors:
        if math.isclose(poly(xs, x), 0):
            return x

    # If no zero was found, return None
    return None


# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
print(find_zero([1, 0, 1]))  # x^2 + 1 = 0 has no real solutions
```
Note that this implementation uses the Rational Root Theorem to find a possible zero of the polynomial. This theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient. In this implementation, we only consider integer factors of the constant term, but in a more general case, you might want to consider rational factors. Also, note that this implementation returns the first zero it finds, and there might be other zeros for the same polynomial.
