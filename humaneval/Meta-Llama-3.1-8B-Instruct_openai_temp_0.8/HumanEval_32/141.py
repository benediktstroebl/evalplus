### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finding

Below is a Python script that defines functions for evaluating polynomials and finding the root of a polynomial.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list, max_iter: int = 10000, tol: float = 1e-5):
    """
    Finds a root of the polynomial defined by coefficients in xs.
    
    Args:
    xs: list of coefficients of the polynomial
    max_iter: maximum number of iterations for the Newton-Raphson method
    tol: tolerance for convergence
    
    Returns:
    A root of the polynomial within the specified tolerance.
    """
    
    # Ensure xs has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient to start from
    start = -1 if xs[0] < 0 else 1
    
    def poly_prime(xs, x):
        return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])
    
    # Use Newton-Raphson method to find a root
    x = start
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        x_new = x - poly(xs, x) / poly_prime(xs, x)
        if abs(x_new - x) < tol:
            return round(x_new, 2)
        x = x_new
    
    # If no convergence within max_iter, return the last estimate
    return round(x, 2)


# Example usage
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

**Note:** This implementation uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial. The `max_iter` and `tol` parameters control the maximum number of iterations and the convergence tolerance, respectively. If no convergence is achieved within `max_iter` iterations, the last estimate is returned.
