### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finding

#### Problem Description
Evaluates a polynomial at a given point and finds the zero of a polynomial.

#### Code

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds the zero of a polynomial given its coefficients.
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    # Check if input is valid (even number of coefficients and largest non-zero coefficient)
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0 or xs[-1] == 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input. Please provide a list of coefficients with an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient.")

    # Convert coefficients to numpy array for easier manipulation
    xs = np.array(xs)

    # Find the root of the polynomial using numpy's roots function
    roots = np.roots(xs)

    # Return the real root with the smallest absolute value
    real_roots = roots[np.isreal(roots)]
    return np.min(real_roots)

# Example usage
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
#### Explanation
The provided code includes two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, which perform polynomial evaluation and zero finding respectively.

1.  `poly(xs, x)`: This function evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`. It uses the `math.pow` function to calculate the power of `x` for each coefficient and then sums the results.
2.  `find_zero(xs)`: This function finds the zero of a polynomial given its coefficients. It first checks if the input is valid, i.e., the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient. If the input is invalid, it raises a `ValueError`.

To find the zero of the polynomial, the code uses the `numpy.roots` function, which calculates the roots of a polynomial with coefficients given in the input array. It then filters out the complex roots and returns the real root with the smallest absolute value.

The code includes example usage at the end to demonstrate how to use the `find_zero` function with different polynomials.
