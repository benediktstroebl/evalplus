This script uses the `numpy` library to create a polynomial from the input list of coefficients. The `poly1d` function creates a polynomial object from the coefficients, and the `r` attribute of this object returns the roots of the polynomial. The root with the smallest absolute value is selected as the solution. 

You can test this function with the examples provided in the original documentation:
```python
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # Output: -0.5
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # Output: 1.0
```
