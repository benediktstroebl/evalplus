### Zero Finder for Polynomials
```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial in descending order of powers.
        x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
        float: The value of the polynomial at point x.

    # Use a generator expression with enumerate to calculate the sum of products

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients.

    Args:
        xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial in descending order of powers.
        
    Returns:
        float: A solution to the equation poly(x) = 0.
    
    Notes:
        This function only takes lists of coefficients with an even number of elements,

This script uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. The `poly` function evaluates the polynomial at a given point, and the `find_zero` function uses the Newton-Raphson formula to iteratively converge to a solution. The function takes a list of coefficients as input, where the largest non-zero coefficient is the leading coefficient, and returns a single solution to the equation `poly(x) = 0`. The function also includes checks to ensure the input list has an even number of elements.
