In this script, the `find_zero` function now uses `numpy` to create a polynomial from the given coefficients and then finds its roots using `np.roots`. It filters out complex roots and returns the one with the largest absolute value.

Please note that this function will return one zero of the polynomial. If there are multiple zeros, it may not return the one you want. For a more robust solution, consider using a library like `sympy` that supports polynomial root finding with higher precision.
