This script uses the `numpy` library to perform numerical computations. The `poly` function evaluates a polynomial at a given point, and the `find_zero` function finds a zero point of a polynomial given its coefficients. The `find_zero` function assumes that the coefficients of the polynomial are given in descending order of power and that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements. If the list of coefficients has an odd number of elements, the function raises a `ValueError`.
