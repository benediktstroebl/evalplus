Note that the above code uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial. This method is an iterative method that starts with an initial guess for the root and repeatedly applies a formula to get a better estimate until it converges to the root. In this case, the formula used is `x -= y`, where `y` is the value of the polynomial at `x`.

Also note that this code assumes that the polynomial has real roots. If the polynomial has complex roots, this code may not work correctly.
