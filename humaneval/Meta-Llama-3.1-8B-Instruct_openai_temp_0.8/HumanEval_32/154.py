However, the previous code does not work with polynomials with more than 4 terms because it relies on algebraic manipulation that only works for polynomials with 4 terms. A general solution for polynomials with any number of terms is found using the numpy library:

```python
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.

    Args:
        xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial
        x (float): point at which to evaluate the polynomial

    Returns:
        float: value of the polynomial at point x
    """
    return np.polyval(xs[::-1], x)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of a polynomial defined by coefficients xs.

    Args:
        xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial (even number of coefficients)

    Returns:
        float: a zero point of the polynomial

    Raises:
        ValueError: if xs does not have an even number of coefficients
    """
    # Check if the list has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:

    # Find all the roots of the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(xs)

    # Check if there are any real roots
    real_roots = roots[np.isreal(roots)]

    # Return the first real root
    return real_roots[0]


# Test cases
