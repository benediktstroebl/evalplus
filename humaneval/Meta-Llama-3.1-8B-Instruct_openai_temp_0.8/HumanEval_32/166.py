However, please be aware that the current implementation does not guarantee finding the root of the polynomial for any polynomial. The current implementation uses a very basic method that might not work for all polynomials. For finding roots of polynomials, we recommend using `numpy.roots()` for simple cases or more advanced libraries for more complex cases. Here is a revised version of the code using `numpy.roots()` for finding the roots of a polynomial:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

def poly(xs: List[float], x: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, len(xs) - 1 - i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero finds all x such that poly(x) = 0.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("List xs must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    coefficients = xs[::-1]  # Reverse the list of coefficients
    roots = np.roots(coefficients)
    
    return roots

# Test cases
print(find_zero([1, 2])) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1])) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

In this version, `numpy.roots()` is used to find all roots of the polynomial. The roots are returned as a numpy array.
