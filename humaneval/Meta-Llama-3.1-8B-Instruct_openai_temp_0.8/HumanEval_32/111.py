### Find Zero of a Polynomial
#### Problem Statement
Given a list of coefficients `xs` representing a polynomial, find a point `x` where `poly(xs, x) = 0`.

#### Solution
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds x such that poly(xs, x) = 0.
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    # Ensure the number of coefficients is even and the largest non-zero coefficient is first
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0 or xs[0] == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list of coefficients with an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient first.")

    # Initialize the bounds for the root
    a = -1
    b = 1

    # Perform binary search to find the root
    while b - a > 1e-6:
        c = (a + b) / 2
        f_c = np.polyval(np.array(xs[::-1]), c)
        f_a = np.polyval(np.array(xs[::-1]), a)
        f_b = np.polyval(np.array(xs[::-1]), b)

        # Adjust the bounds based on the polynomial's behavior
        if np.sign(f_c) == np.sign(f_a):
            a = c
        else:
            b = c

    return (a + b) / 2
```
#### Example Usage
```python
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
Note: This implementation uses a modified binary search approach to find the root, which is more efficient than a naive approach. However, it's worth noting that this implementation assumes the existence of a single root within the specified bounds, which may not always be the case.
