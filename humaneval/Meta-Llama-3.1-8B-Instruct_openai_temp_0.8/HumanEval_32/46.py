### Zero Finding for Polynomial Expressions

This Python script evaluates polynomials and finds zero points.
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    Returns xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * x**i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    Returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    This function only takes lists xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    """
    # Check if the number of coefficients is even
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("The number of coefficients must be even")

    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient
    largest_coeff = max(coeff for coeff in xs if coeff!= 0)

    # Find the index of the largest non-zero coefficient
    largest_index = xs.index(largest_coeff)

    # Initialize a list to store the coefficients of the derivative
    derivative_coeffs = [i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i!= 0]

    # Scale the derivative coefficients to get the correct precision
    derivative_coeffs = [-largest_coeff * coeff / largest_index for coeff in derivative_coeffs]

    # Find the zero of the derivative
    x = -derivative_coeffs[1] / derivative_coeffs[0]

    return x

# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2)) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2)) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

In this improved version, we're using a more robust method to find the zero of the polynomial. We're finding the largest non-zero coefficient, creating the coefficients for the derivative of the polynomial with this largest coefficient, and then finding the zero of the derivative. We're also checking if the number of coefficients is even to guarantee a solution.

Note that this method assumes that the polynomial has at least one zero, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem statement. If the polynomial has no zeros, this method will not work correctly.

Also, note that this method is not guaranteed to find the correct zero for every polynomial, especially when the polynomial has multiple zeros of the same multiplicity. For example, the polynomial `(x - 2)^2` will not be handled correctly by this method.
