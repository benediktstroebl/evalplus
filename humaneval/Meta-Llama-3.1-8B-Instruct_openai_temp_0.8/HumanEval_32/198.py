This code uses a binary search method to find the zero point of a polynomial. The binary search algorithm is efficient for finding the root of a polynomial, with a time complexity of O(log(n)), where n is the number of coefficients. The find_zero function now correctly handles polynomials with even numbers of coefficients and finds the zero point using a binary search method.
