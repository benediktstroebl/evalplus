In this code, `find_zero` uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. The derivative of the polynomial is calculated using the power rule for differentiation. The first root of the derivative is used as an initial estimate for the root of the polynomial, and then improved using Newton's method. The code includes test cases to demonstrate its usage.
