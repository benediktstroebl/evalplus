### Finding Zeroes of a Polynomial using Newton-Raphson Method
#### Function to Find Zeroes of a Polynomial

```python
import math

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of a polynomial with coefficients xs.
    
    Args:
    xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial. The coefficient at index 'n' represents the coefficient of x^n in the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    float: A zero of the polynomial.
    """
    
    # Check if the polynomial has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("The polynomial must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Start with a random guess
    x = 1.0
    
    # Maximum number of iterations
    max_iter = 1000
    
    # Convergence threshold
    threshold = 1e-6
    
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        # Evaluate the polynomial at the current guess
        f_x = xs[0]
        f_prime_x = xs[1]
        for i in range(2, len(xs), 2):
            f_x += xs[i] * math.pow(x, i)
            f_prime_x += i * xs[i] * math.pow(x, i - 1)
        
        # Check if the polynomial has degenerate derivative
        if f_prime_x == 0:
            raise ValueError("The polynomial has a degenerate derivative at the current guess")
        
        # Update the guess using Newton-Raphson method
        x = x - f_x / f_prime_x
        
        # Check if the guess has converged
        if abs(f_x) < threshold:
            break
    
    return round(x, 2)
```

#### Example Usage

```python
# Test the function
print(find_zero([1, 2]))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
