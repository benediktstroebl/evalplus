Note that I've added some error handling to ensure the input list of coefficients has an even number of elements and that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end. I've also implemented the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial.

This implementation assumes that the polynomial has at least one root. If the polynomial has no roots, the Newton-Raphson method may not converge.

Also, the implementation uses a simple tolerance-based stopping criterion. If the method fails to converge after a maximum number of iterations, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
