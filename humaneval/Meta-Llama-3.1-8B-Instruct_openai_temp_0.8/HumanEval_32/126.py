Here's a Python script that solves the problem using the `numpy` library for efficient polynomial evaluation.

```markdown
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def poly_np(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x using numpy.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    x = np.array([x])
    coeffs = np.array(xs, dtype=float)
    return np.polyval(coeffs[::-1], x)[0]

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    Guarantee a solution by checking for largest non-zero coefficient
    and ensuring an even number of coefficients.

    Returns the single zero point.
    """
    # Guarantee a solution by checking for largest non-zero coefficient
    # and ensuring an even number of coefficients
    n = len(xs)
    if n % 2!= 0 or not np.any(xs):
        raise ValueError("The polynomial must have an even number of coefficients "
                         "and a non-zero constant term.")

    a = max((coeff for coeff in xs if coeff!= 0))
    index = np.argmax([coeff for coeff in xs if coeff == a])
    x = -xs[index] / (xs[-1] + xs[-2] * xs[-1] / a)

    return x

# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

For `poly_np`, note the reversal of the coefficients when using `np.polyval`, as the polynomial is defined with the highest degree term first in NumPy.

This solution provides a balance between readability and performance. The `poly` function serves as a reference implementation, while `poly_np` uses NumPy for more efficient polynomial evaluation. The `find_zero` function now includes input validation and leverages the property of polynomials with an even number of coefficients to guarantee a solution.
