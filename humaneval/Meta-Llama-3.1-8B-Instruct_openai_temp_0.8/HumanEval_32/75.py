### Evaluating Polynomial and Finding Zero
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    - xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial
    - x (float): point at which to evaluate the polynomial
    
    Returns:
    - float: value of the polynomial at x
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of a polynomial with the given coefficients.

    Args:
    - xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial (must be an even number of elements)

    Returns:
    - float: a zero of the polynomial (only one is guaranteed)

    Note:
    This function only works with polynomials that have a large absolute value of the highest non-zero coefficient.
    """
    # Check if the polynomial has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("Polynomial must have an even number of coefficients")

    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient index
    max_non_zero_idx = max((i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if coeff!= 0), default=None)

    # Initialize the range of possible roots
    low = -1
    high = 1

    # Perform a binary search for the zero
    while abs(high - low) > 1e-10:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        poly_val = poly(xs, mid)
        if abs(poly_val) < 1e-10:
            high = mid
        elif poly_val < 0:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid

    # Return a root
    return high


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define polynomials as lists of coefficients
    polys = {
        "f(x) = 1 + 2x": [1, 2],
        "f(x) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3": [-6, 11, -6, 1],
    }

    for name, coeffs in polys.items():
        print(f"Polynomial: {name}")
        print(f"Zero: {round(find_zero(coeffs), 2)}")

```
Note: The original `find_zero` function did not handle cases where the polynomial's largest non-zero coefficient had a small absolute value. This updated version uses a binary search to find a root, which is more robust in such cases. However, it still may not be effective for polynomials with many roots or those with roots very close together.
