## Polynomial Solver
### Overview
This script defines two functions, `poly` and `find_zero`, to evaluate and find the root of a polynomial respectively.

### Code
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    - xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial.
    - x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    - float: The value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of a polynomial given its coefficients.
    
    Args:
    - xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial. The list must have an even number of elements.
    
    Returns:
    - float: A zero point of the polynomial.
    
    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the list of coefficients does not have an even number of elements.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("The list of coefficients must have an even number of elements.")

    max_nonzero_coeff = max(coeff for coeff in xs if coeff!= 0)
    idx = xs.index(max_nonzero_coeff)

    # Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial
    def f(x):
        return poly(xs, x)

    def f_prime(x):
        return poly([i * xs[i] for i in range(len(xs))], x)

    x = 1.0  # initial guess
    for _ in range(100):  # maximum number of iterations
        x = x - f(x) / f_prime(x)
        if abs(f(x)) < 1e-6:  # tolerance for convergence
            break

    return x

# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
### Notes
This script uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. This method is an iterative method that starts with an initial guess and iteratively improves it until convergence. The `poly` function evaluates the polynomial at a given point, and the `find_zero` function uses this function to find a root of the polynomial.
