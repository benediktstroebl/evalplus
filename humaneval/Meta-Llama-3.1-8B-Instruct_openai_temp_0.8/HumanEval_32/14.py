### Evaluating Polynomial and Finding Zeroes

The following Python script defines two functions: `poly` for evaluating a polynomial at a given point, and `find_zero` for finding a zero of a polynomial. It uses the `math.pow` function for polynomial evaluation and the `numpy` library for polynomial root finding.

```markdown
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    
    Parameters:
    xs (list): Coefficients of the polynomial
    
    Returns:
    float: A zero of the polynomial
    """
    # Ensure the list has an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("List must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient
    non_zero_coeffs = [coeff for coeff in xs if coeff!= 0]
    largest_coeff = max(non_zero_coeffs)
    
    # Create a numpy polynomial object
    poly_obj = np.poly1d(xs)
    
    # Find the root of the polynomial
    root = np.roots(poly_obj)[0]
    
    return round(root.real, 2)

# Example usage
print(find_zero([1, 2]))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
```

Note that the `find_zero` function now uses the `numpy` library to find the root of the polynomial, which is more efficient and accurate than the original implementation. The function also raises a `ValueError` if the input list does not have an even number of coefficients.
