### Finding the Zero of a Polynomial

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial.
        x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
        float: The value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * (x ** i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds the zero of a polynomial with even number of coefficients.
    
    This function uses the fact that a polynomial with even number of coefficients
    can be factored into the product of two binomials of the form (x - a) and (x - b).
    We find the largest non-zero coefficient and use it to find the zero of the polynomial.
    
    Args:
        xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial with even number of coefficients.
    
    Returns:
        float: The zero of the polynomial.
    """
    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient
    max_coeff_idx = np.argmax(np.abs(xs[:-1]))
    
    # Calculate the value at x = 1 and x = -1
    val_at_1 = poly(xs, 1)
    val_at_neg1 = poly(xs, -1)
    
    # If the value at x = 1 is zero, return 1
    if val_at_1 == 0:
        return 1
    
    # If the value at x = -1 is zero, return -1
    elif val_at_neg1 == 0:
        return -1
    
    # Otherwise, use the fact that a polynomial with even number of coefficients
    # can be factored into the product of two binomials of the form (x - a) and (x - b)
    # to find the zero of the polynomial
    else:
        return -1 if (xs[0] + xs[-1]) < 0 else 1


# Test cases
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

Note that this implementation assumes that the input polynomial has an even number of coefficients and that the largest non-zero coefficient is at an even index. If this is not the case, the function may not work correctly.
