However, as we can see in the code above the algorithm for root finding in the function find_zero doesn't guarantee finding the root. It is more of a simple test to see if the polynomial value is close to 0.
For an efficient way to find roots we should use a library like numpy that has an efficient implementation of a root-finding algorithm.
