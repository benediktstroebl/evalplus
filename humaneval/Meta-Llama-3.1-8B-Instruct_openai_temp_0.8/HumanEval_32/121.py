### Solution: Find Zero of a Polynomial

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    It is assumed that xs have even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    # Ensure list has even number of coefficients
    assert len(xs) % 2 == 0, "List must have even number of coefficients"

    # Initialize roots to None
    roots = None

    # Perform binary search to find root
    low = -1
    high = 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        poly_value = poly(xs, mid)
        if poly_value == 0:
            roots = mid
            break
        elif poly_value < 0:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid

    return roots

# Example usage
print(f"Round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) == {round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2)}") # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(f"round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) == {round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2)}") # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

However, this approach relies on a binary search method, which is an approximation method and does not always find the exact root.

A more accurate way to find the roots of a polynomial is by using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or the Bisection method.

Here is the code using the Newton-Raphson method:

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def derivative(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates derivative of polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return 1*x^1 + 2*x^2 + 3*x^3 +... + n*x^n
    """
    return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list, epsilon=1e-5, max_iterations=1000):
    """
    Find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    It is assumed that xs have even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    # Ensure list has even number of coefficients
    assert len(xs) % 2 == 0, "List must have even number of coefficients"

    # Initialize guess to 0
    guess = 0
