### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finding
```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.

    Args:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial.
    x (float): The point at which to evaluate the polynomial.

    Returns:
    float: The value of the polynomial at point x.

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of a polynomial with given coefficients.

    Args:
    xs (list): A list of coefficients of the polynomial. The list must have an even number of elements
               and the largest non-zero coefficient must be at the end.

    Returns:
    float: A zero point of the polynomial.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the input list is not a list of numbers or does not have an even number of elements.

    if not isinstance(xs, list) or not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in xs):
        raise ValueError("Input list must be a list of numbers")
    if len(xs) % 2 == 1:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have an even number of elements")

    # Since the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end, we can divide the polynomial by it
    # This is equivalent to finding the root of the polynomial divided by the largest coefficient
    # We use the fact that the polynomial can be factored as (x - r) * p(x), where p(x) is the polynomial
    # divided by the largest coefficient and r is the root
    # We use the fact that if f(x) = 0, then f(-x) = -f(x)
    # So if the largest coefficient is positive, the root must be negative
    # And if the largest coefficient is negative, the root must be positive
    root = -math.pow(-xs[-1] / xs[0], 1 / (len(xs) - 1))
    return root

# Example usage
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
print(round(find_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4
```
Note: This solution assumes that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end of the list as per the problem statement. It also assumes that the list has an even number of elements, which is also a requirement of the problem statement. If the list does not meet these requirements, it raises a ValueError. 

The find_zero function uses the fact that the polynomial can be factored as (x - r) * p(x), where p(x) is the polynomial divided by the largest coefficient and r is the root. It also uses the fact that if f(x) = 0, then f(-x) = -f(x) to determine the sign of the root. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of coefficients in the polynomial, because it uses a single loop to iterate over the coefficients. The space complexity is O(n) because it uses a list to store the coefficients
