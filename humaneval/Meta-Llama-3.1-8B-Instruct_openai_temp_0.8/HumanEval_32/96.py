### Using NumPy for Efficient Polynomial Evaluation

Here's a more efficient version of the script using NumPy for polynomial evaluation and numerical methods from `scipy.optimize` for finding roots.

### Required Libraries
```

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import root_scalar

def poly(xs: np.ndarray, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return np.polyval(xs[::-1], x)

def find_zero(xs: np.ndarray):
    """
    Finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    xs should be a list having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    # Reverse coefficients for numpy's polyval function
    xs = xs[::-1]

    # Use brentq method for root finding
    return root_scalar(lambda x: poly(xs, x), bracket=[-5, 5]).root
```

### Example Use Cases

```python
# Test the functions
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

This code uses the `np.polyval` function for efficient polynomial evaluation and `root_scalar` from `scipy.optimize` for finding roots of the polynomial. It also reverses the coefficients before passing them to `np.polyval` to match the expected format. The `brentq` method is used for root finding, which is a robust and efficient method for finding roots of a function.
