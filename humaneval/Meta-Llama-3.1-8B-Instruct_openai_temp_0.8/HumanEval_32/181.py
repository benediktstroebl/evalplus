### Polynomial Evaluation and Zero Finding Script
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.

    Args:
        xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial.
        x (float): the point at which to evaluate the polynomial.

    Returns:
        float: the value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero point of a polynomial given its coefficients.

    Args:
        xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial. The list must have an even number of elements.

    Returns:
        float: a zero point of the polynomial.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the list xs does not have an even number of elements.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("The list xs must have an even number of elements")

    # Use numpy to find the roots of the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(xs)
    # Return the real root that is closest to the origin
    return roots[np.isreal(roots)][np.argmin(np.abs(roots[np.isreal(roots)]))].real


# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
Note that in the `find_zero` function, we use the `numpy.roots` function to find the roots of the polynomial, which is generally more efficient and accurate than the original implementation. We also added a check to ensure that the list `xs` has an even number of elements, and raise a `ValueError` if it does not.
