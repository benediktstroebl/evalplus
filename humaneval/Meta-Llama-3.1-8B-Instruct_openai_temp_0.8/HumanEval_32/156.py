```python
import math
import cmath
import numpy as np


def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Check if the largest non-zero coefficient is non-zero
    if not any(coeff!= 0 for coeff in xs):
        raise ValueError("xs must have a non-zero coefficient")
    
    # Find the largest non-zero coefficient
    largest_non_zero_coeff = next((coeff for coeff in xs if coeff!= 0), None)
    
    # Find the root of the polynomial
    x = -xs[1] / xs[0]
    
    return round(x, 2)


# Test the function
print(find_zero([1, 2]))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

However, this approach has limitations. It only finds one root, even if there are multiple roots. To find all roots, you would need a more advanced algorithm.

Here is an improved version using a numerical method to find roots:

```python
import numpy as np


def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_roots(xs: list):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Check if the largest non-zero coefficient is non-zero
    if not any(coeff!= 0 for coeff in xs):
        raise ValueError("xs must have a non-zero coefficient")
    
    # Find the roots of the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(xs)
    
    return [round(root.real, 2) + round(root.imag, 2)*1j for root in roots]


# Test the function
print(find_roots([1, 2]))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(find_roots([-6, 11, -6, 1]))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
This version uses the `np.roots` function from numpy, which returns all roots of the polynomial. Note that this function returns complex roots if they exist.
