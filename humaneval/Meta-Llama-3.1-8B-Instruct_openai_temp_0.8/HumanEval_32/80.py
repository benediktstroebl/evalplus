```

However, the `np.roots()` function in numpy might provide complex roots, and real roots with smallest absolute value have been chosen. 

This function relies on the condition that the input list `xs` represents a polynomial with all its roots real. It will not work correctly for polynomials with complex roots. 

If you need to handle polynomials with complex roots, consider using a numerical method like Newton's method or the Jenkins-Traub algorithm, which can be implemented in Python.
