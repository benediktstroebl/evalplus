**Explanation:** The `find_zero` function uses an iterative method to find a zero point of the polynomial. It only works if the coefficients are given in descending order with the largest non-zero coefficient first. If the coefficients do not meet these conditions, it raises a `ValueError`. The iterative method uses two consecutive coefficients of the polynomial to compute an approximation of the zero point. 

**Note:** This is a simple implementation and may not be accurate for all polynomials. It can be improved using more advanced methods, such as the "bisection method" or "Newton's method".
