### Solution
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 +.... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    Only one zero point is returned, even if there are many.
    xs must be a list with an even number of coefficients.
    The largest non-zero coefficient is assumed to be the 0th coefficient.
    """
    # Ensure xs is a list with an even number of coefficients
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("xs must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    # Create a polynomial from the coefficients
    p = np.poly1d(xs)
    
    # Find the roots of the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(p)
    
    # Return the real root that is closest to 0
    return np.real(roots[np.argmin(np.abs(roots))])

# Test cases
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2)) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2)) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```
Note that the `find_zero` function now uses NumPy's `poly1d` and `roots` functions to find the roots of the polynomial, which are more efficient and accurate than the original implementation. The test cases are also included to demonstrate the function's usage.
