**Finding Roots of a Polynomial**
=====================================

The following Python script uses the `numpy` library to find the roots of a polynomial.

```python
import numpy as np

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    
    Args:
    - xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial in descending order of powers.
    - x (float): point at which the polynomial is evaluated.
    
    Returns:
    - float: value of the polynomial at point x.
    """
    return sum([coeff * x**i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of a polynomial.
    
    Args:
    - xs (list): coefficients of the polynomial in descending order of powers.
    
    Returns:
    - float: a root of the polynomial.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2!= 0:
        raise ValueError("Polynomial must have an even number of coefficients")
    
    if xs[0] == 0:
        raise ValueError("Largest non-zero coefficient must be the first one")
    
    # We use numpy's roots function to find all roots of the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(xs)
    
    # We return the first real root
    for root in roots:
        if root.imag == 0:
            return root.real
```

**Example Usage**
-----------------

```python
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
```

Note that this script uses `numpy` to find the roots of the polynomial, which is more efficient and accurate than the original implementation. It also checks if the input list has an even number of coefficients and if the largest non-zero coefficient is the first one, as required by the problem statement.
