    My Approach:
    Traverse the list and compute the sum of every pair of elements.
    If a pair with a sum of zero exists, then return True,
    otherwise return False.

    """
    There is a solution that will run in O(n^2) time, but we can do better.
    The brute force solution has O(n^3) time complexity because we loop through the list n times and check
    if the sum of two elements of the list equals to zero n times.

    For every element in the list, we check the sum of this element and all the other elements.
    This means that we are looping through the list twice:
    One loop for each element in the list.
    This means that the brute force solution will have O(n^2) time complexity.

    To solve this issue, we can sort the list first.
    This will sort the list in O(nlogn) time.
    Then, we only need to loop through the sorted list one time.
    The inner loop will break if we find a pair with sum equal to zero.
