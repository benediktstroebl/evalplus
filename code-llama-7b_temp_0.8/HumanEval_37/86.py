    # This function is equivalent to the solution in the book,
    # but that solution has a bug
    # The bug is that if len(l) is odd, the value at index (len(l)-1)/2 is also moved
    # to the even position
    # As an example, consider the list [5, 6, 3, 4, 2]
    # Here, sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4, 2]) == [5, 3, 6, 4, 2]
    # This is wrong: the first 3 should be in position 1, as in the correct answer [3, 6, 5, 4, 2]
    #
    # Another way to think about it: suppose you have an even length list
    # in which the odd indicies are numbered 0, 2, 4, ..., and the even indicies
    # are numbered 1, 3, 5, ..., so that even indicies are one more than odd indicies
    # Then, in the correct answer, the first element of the original list is at position
    # 0, while in the wrong answer it is at position 1.
    # But if you have an odd length list, then the position of the first element of the
    # original list is different, so that the solution is still correct.
    # This is not a bug in the book's answer, but is rather a consequence of the fact that
    # the given function may have a bug.
